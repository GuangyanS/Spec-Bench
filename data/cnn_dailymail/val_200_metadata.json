Mr Xie told the male pupils from Nanguang High School in Fujian to stay behind after class on Thursday because they were being too loud. He made the students crouch on the floor while he played on his phone and put his bare feet on their backs,\u00a0People's Daily Online reported. Mr Xie, who has been a teacher for 27 years, was dismissed after the Nan'an City Education Department saw a picture on social media. The image shows both students being made to kneel on the ground in their school uniforms in front of a crowd of pupils. Mr Liu, headteacher, said Mr Xie, who is in his 40s, was supervising a small self-study group around 7.30pm when the two students were too noisy. The Year One pupils - thought to be aged between six and seven - were taken into a different room and told to kneel on the ground. Mr Liu said the footstool photo was taken as a joke and added that Mr Xie, who was in charge of disciplining the male students at the school, 'performed well in his work and was extremely talented'. Nan'an City Department of Education said it took immediate action. It requested the school apologise to students and parents, and said that student counselling should also be offered. Stronger ethics and appropriate styles of teaching would be implemented at the school, the department added. Mr Liu said that a school representative had already gone to the homes of the two students to apologise formally.

He said: 'Mr Xie\u2019s actions were in violation of our policies and there had to be some form of punishment by the school.'

A Spain international and one of Atletico's most creative influences, Koke missed last month's first leg defeat in Germany due to injury but has featured in Atletico's last three outings in La Liga. The 23-year-old, who scored in this month's 1-1 draw at home to Valencia, is also a dead ball specialist and the Spanish champions have netted a host of goals from his corners and free kicks. Atletico Madrid head coach Diego Simeone and Mario Suarez attend a press conference on the eve of the tie . Simeone believes Koke returning will be a boost for his team as they try to overturn a first-leg deficit . 'He is one of those all-round midfielders who is gifted at reading the game, he knows how to play in different positions in the centre and he has very good peripheral vision,' Simeone told a news conference. 'When he is on top form, he allows us to play with speed. Not because he is fast himself but because his vision allows us to play that way.' Atletico, last season's beaten finalists, have been struggling for goals in recent weeks and have only scored once in their last four outings in all competitions.

Leverkusen, by contrast, have racked up 11 goals without reply in winning their last five games in all competitions, including Friday's 4-0 drubbing of VfB Stuttgart. Simeone said breaking out of defence swiftly would be one of the keys to Tuesday's clash at the Calderon. 'We need to shake off their pressuring quickly when they are trying to win back the ball,' Simeone said. 'They know very well how to disrupt play and hold you up,' added the former Argentina captain. 'That's what happened in Germany. They stopped our attacks quickly with fouls and we couldn't develop our vertical game. If we don't take the ball forward quickly we will have problems.'

Singh and his former government have repeatedly denied accusations they cost the treasury billions of dollars in lost revenue by selling coalfields to private companies, without allowing competitive bidding. The 82-year-old leader, who served as the nation's prime minister for two successive terms until last year, was not named as a defendant in the original dossier of charges, said Kanchan Prasad, the spokeswoman for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Nevertheless, the trial court summoned him and some other corporate leaders to testify in person on April 8, she said. The case Singh has been asked to appear for relates to the licensing of a coal block to a private firm some 10 years ago, when he was also guardian of the nation's coal ministry. The summons has been issued under India's anti-corruption law. Singh said he was open to legal scrutiny. \"(I) Am sure that the truth will prevail and I will get a chance to put forward my case with all the facts. I have always said I am open for legal scrutiny. Of course I am upset,  but this is part of life,\" he said in a text message issued by his office. Singh's Congress Party also came to his defense. The former prime minister functioned with \"utmost probity and utmost transparency\" during his term, said senior Congress Party leader Manish Tiwari. He said Singh's legal team would thoroughly examine the summons, and indicated it may be challenged in a higher court. The Oxford-Cambridge educated Singh has been credited with ushering in economic reforms in India as its finance minister in the 1990s. In his first term as prime minister, he initiated a historic nuclear deal with the United States that ended the South Asian nation's decades-old isolation in the global nuclear market. His second tenure was hit by the unearthing of a series of scandals spread across various sectors. In 2012, the national auditor alleged a widespread scam in the allocation of coal blocks. India depends heavily on coal for power. The fuel is abundantly available in the country, but that's still not enough to satisfy the demand for energy in Asia's third-largest economy. For the current financial year, national demand for thermal coal to produce energy has been estimated at 551.6 million tonnes, according to official figures. Of it, at least 84.7 million tonnes is being met through imports, coal minister Piyush Goyal told the Indian parliament in December. The state-run monopoly Coal India Limited (CIL) accounts for more than 80% of the output. Plans by current Prime Minister Narendra Modi for future privatization of the industry faced resistance recently, when CIL workers stopped work in January. The two-day strike -- the biggest of its kind in four decades -- not only severely limited the ability of the companies to meet their production quotas, but forced the government to go slow on reforms.", "Tuberculosis has spread through a Kansas high school after a single case of the disease was discovered. Some 27 people have tested positive for latent TB infection at the school in eastern Kansas. State and county health officials made the announcement on Wednesday after tests were conducted on more than 300 Olathe Northwest High  students and staff who came into contact with a student with TB disease. Officials called people who tested positive on Monday and those with no sign of infection were to receive letters in the mail. One student with TB at Olathe Northwest High School has led to 27 cases of the infection in eastern Kansas among fellow students and staff . According to the Johnson County Department of Heath and Environment, those with TB infection were not contagious, do not feel sick and do not have symptoms. People with TB disease can spread the bacteria to others, feel sick and have symptoms including fever, night sweats, cough and weight loss. Causes:\u00a0Tuberculosis is spread from person to person through the air, when someone infected coughs, sneezes, laughs or sings. A person who breathes in the bacteria can become infected. Symptoms: General symptoms may include feeling weak or sick, weight loss, fever and/or night sweats. Symptoms of TB of the lungs may include coughing, chest pain and/or coughing up blood. Treatment:\u00a0More than 13,000 cases are reported in the U.S. each year. There are also an estimated 10 to 15 million people in the U.S. who are infected with the TB germ, with potential to develop TB disease in the future. If a person gets a TB skin test and it comes back positive, they must take a variety of antibiotics daily for as long as six months. Director of the health department, Lougene Marsh, said: 'The number of individuals with TB infection does not exceed what we would anticipate in this setting.' Tuberculosis can be spread by coughing and sneezing. People with the disease were most likely to spread it to others with whom they have prolonged contact. According to the CDC, TB is caused by a bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis which attacks the lungs but can also infect the kidneys, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, the disease can be fatal. The Department of Heath and Environment said those who tested positive for TB will have a chest x-ray and begin a course of antibiotics to kill the TB bacteria. In May, those who were in the same class as the student with TB disease will be given another round of blood tests as it can sometimes take eight weeks for the bacteria to show itself. A total of 9,582 TB disease cases were reported in the U.S. in 2013 - compared to 84,304 cases when the CDC began records in 1953. The same year, 9 million people around the world became sick with TB disease, leading to 1.5 million deaths.

The 21-year-old's fortunes on the pitch have mirrored that of his team as neither have been able to reproduce the standards of last season, when a brilliant campaign saw the Toffees finish fifth after being in contention for the Champions League for a long period. Barkley has struggled to rediscover the form which made him such an integral part of the team's success but he is working hard to get back to his best. Everton midfielder Ross Barkley has admitted he has failed to replicate last season's performances . Barkley, pictured scoring against Newcastle, has netted just two goals so far this season . 'From my point of view I haven't done as well as I know I can, but things like this happen,' said the England international. 'You have to go through bad days to get to the great days you have in your career. 'Everything's a learning curve. We haven't been going through the best period at the moment but we're going to come through this and be really good at the end of it. 'I don't feel pressure. I believe in myself and I know what I can do. It's not me feeling pressure, it's just me putting pressure on myself if I don't do my best, and I know I can do better. The 21-year-old (right) is expected to start against Italy after coming on in the second half against Lithuania . 'I just focus on getting better every day, putting things right in training and then hopefully what I'm doing right in training I'm going to show in games as well.' Barkley, when he has started, has found himself switching positions regularly and has not been given a long spell behind the centre forward where he was most effective last season. Many observers appear to have pencilled him in for a deeper midfield role but he does not feel that will get the best out of him. 'I'm a striker,' he said. 'I feel I can have my greatest impact there because I'm free to roam around the pitch, take players on, have shots and create chances.'", "Arsenal and Southampton are battling it out over a deal worth \u00a31m for Newcastle keeper Freddie Woodman. The England Under-19, who plays for the national team against France on Tuesday evening as they target a place in the European Championship finals, is one of the biggest prospects in the game. Woodman, the 18-year-old who is the son of Newcastle\u2019s keeper coach Andy Woodman, has already represented England at Under-16 and Under-17 level.

Newcastle want Woodman to stay at St James\u2019 Park, but the young keeper will be tempted by interest from other teams in the Barclays Premier League. Arsenal and Saints, who have already put down their markers for the keeper, would allow Woodman out on loan next season to gain vital first team experience.

The powerhouse centre, one of the first names on Stuart Lancaster\u2019s team-sheet when fit, has not featured since October and faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup in September after suspicions his groin injury was worse than first thought were confirmed by Leicester. Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: \u2018Manu is improving but it is a long process. The likelihood is, he may not play this season. He may or may not play this season.\u2019 England coach Stuart Lancaster (left) has been hit by the news Manu Tuilagi could miss the World Cup . Tuilagi (centre) has a groin injury that could rule him out of England's tournament in September . Fears that Tuilagi's groin injury is worse than first feared were confirmed by his club Leicester . The 23-year-old, who Mailsport understands is suffering from the notoriously troublesome condition known as \u2018Gilmore\u2019s Groin\u2019, is now likely to have just three warm-up matches this summer to prove his fitness ahead of the World Cup, which kicks off on September 18. Leicester, who have conducted a root and branch review of their medical department this season, have repeatedly insisted his return is imminent despite growing rumours the problem is more serious than they have let on. In February Cockerill accused Tuilagi of inadvertently exaggerating the extent of his injury after he gave an interview saying he would not feature in the Six Nations. Tuilagi is considered one of the first names on the England team-sheet when he is fit to play . Tuilagi will try to be fit for the start of England's World Cup campaign, which begins on September 18 . Tuilagi (right) missed the whole of England's Six Nations campaign due to injury . As it transpired, he played no role in tournament, although he did spend time with England\u2019s medical team and remains a valued member of the squad. But serious questions will now be asked about the management of his injury after surgery was delayed in a bid to get him fit. England had better news last night when Saracens confirmed injured duo Owen Farrell and Brad Barritt as expected to return in the next two to three weeks.", "Ross McCormack has withdrawn from the Scotland squad for the double-header against Northern Ireland and Gibraltar, the Scottish Football Association has confirmed. The 28-year-old Fulham forward picked up a knee injury playing against Leeds in midweek.

'But then the second whack on it meant he had to come off. We will know more soon but it is certainly sore at the moment. McCormack is seen by medics at Craven Cottage before being taken off against his former club .", "No parent wants to hear that their child is a bully - and thanks to the stiff punishment he dreamed up, this father is unlikely to hear it twice. Timothy Robenhorst, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, was shocked to find out his son Kayden had been mistreating a classmate, and in response gave him a tough workout, gardening duty and instructions to apologize. For the physically grueling stages of his 5-part punishment, Kayden was dragged out of bed at 4:30am and made to do 50 push-ups on his fists. Spelling it out: Timothy Robenhorst was shocked to heard his son, Kayden, had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him . Next, the boy was tasked with performing ten tougher, incline push-ups, then running a mile. Early-morning Wisconsin temperatures are still routinely below freezing. But Kayden's labors were not over after his hellish morning workout - and the boy is stuck doing landscaping work at two houses his father apparently owns for an unspecified length of time. Punished: Kayden, pictured, was given an array of unpleasant tasks to make up for his wrongs . But the punishment also has an emotional and social aspect - with Kayden also being instructed to apologize to his victim in front of his entire class the day after, which was set to happen Wednesday. Robenhorst then posed for a photograph with his son and a poster spelling out his punishment, and encouraged people to share it. As of Friday night it had been shared more than 1,000 times. He also seemingly insisted that it be posted on Kayden's profile too, where it was set as his profile picture and cover photo. Under the post, Robenhorst wrote: 'I teach my kids they do not start fights but if someone puts their hands on them they finish it. 'This is what happens when you become a bully! I don't put up with it and at 4:30am today my son found out what happens when you pray on people for no reason and bully! 'Please share this to end this behavior everywhere! Nothing changes until you take a stance and it only takes one person to start a revolution!'
