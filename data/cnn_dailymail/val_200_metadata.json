Mr Xie told the male pupils from Nanguang High School in Fujian to stay behind after class on Thursday because they were being too loud. He made the students crouch on the floor while he played on his phone and put his bare feet on their backs,\u00a0People's Daily Online reported. Mr Xie, who has been a teacher for 27 years, was dismissed after the Nan'an City Education Department saw a picture on social media. The image shows both students being made to kneel on the ground in their school uniforms in front of a crowd of pupils. Mr Liu, headteacher, said Mr Xie, who is in his 40s, was supervising a small self-study group around 7.30pm when the two students were too noisy. The Year One pupils - thought to be aged between six and seven - were taken into a different room and told to kneel on the ground. Mr Liu said the footstool photo was taken as a joke and added that Mr Xie, who was in charge of disciplining the male students at the school, 'performed well in his work and was extremely talented'. Nan'an City Department of Education said it took immediate action. It requested the school apologise to students and parents, and said that student counselling should also be offered. Stronger ethics and appropriate styles of teaching would be implemented at the school, the department added. Mr Liu said that a school representative had already gone to the homes of the two students to apologise formally.

He said: 'Mr Xie\u2019s actions were in violation of our policies and there had to be some form of punishment by the school.'

A Spain international and one of Atletico's most creative influences, Koke missed last month's first leg defeat in Germany due to injury but has featured in Atletico's last three outings in La Liga. The 23-year-old, who scored in this month's 1-1 draw at home to Valencia, is also a dead ball specialist and the Spanish champions have netted a host of goals from his corners and free kicks. Atletico Madrid head coach Diego Simeone and Mario Suarez attend a press conference on the eve of the tie . Simeone believes Koke returning will be a boost for his team as they try to overturn a first-leg deficit . 'He is one of those all-round midfielders who is gifted at reading the game, he knows how to play in different positions in the centre and he has very good peripheral vision,' Simeone told a news conference. 'When he is on top form, he allows us to play with speed. Not because he is fast himself but because his vision allows us to play that way.' Atletico, last season's beaten finalists, have been struggling for goals in recent weeks and have only scored once in their last four outings in all competitions.

Simeone said breaking out of defence swiftly would be one of the keys to Tuesday's clash at the Calderon. 'We need to shake off their pressuring quickly when they are trying to win back the ball,' Simeone said. 'They know very well how to disrupt play and hold you up,' added the former Argentina captain. 'That's what happened in Germany. They stopped our attacks quickly with fouls and we couldn't develop our vertical game. If we don't take the ball forward quickly we will have problems.'

Singh and his former government have repeatedly denied accusations they cost the treasury billions of dollars in lost revenue by selling coalfields to private companies, without allowing competitive bidding. The 82-year-old leader, who served as the nation's prime minister for two successive terms until last year, was not named as a defendant in the original dossier of charges, said Kanchan Prasad, the spokeswoman for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Nevertheless, the trial court summoned him and some other corporate leaders to testify in person on April 8, she said. The case Singh has been asked to appear for relates to the licensing of a coal block to a private firm some 10 years ago, when he was also guardian of the nation's coal ministry. The summons has been issued under India's anti-corruption law. Singh said he was open to legal scrutiny. \"(I) Am sure that the truth will prevail and I will get a chance to put forward my case with all the facts. I have always said I am open for legal scrutiny. Of course I am upset,  but this is part of life,\" he said in a text message issued by his office. Singh's Congress Party also came to his defense. The former prime minister functioned with \"utmost probity and utmost transparency\" during his term, said senior Congress Party leader Manish Tiwari. He said Singh's legal team would thoroughly examine the summons, and indicated it may be challenged in a higher court. The Oxford-Cambridge educated Singh has been credited with ushering in economic reforms in India as its finance minister in the 1990s. In his first term as prime minister, he initiated a historic nuclear deal with the United States that ended the South Asian nation's decades-old isolation in the global nuclear market. His second tenure was hit by the unearthing of a series of scandals spread across various sectors. In 2012, the national auditor alleged a widespread scam in the allocation of coal blocks. India depends heavily on coal for power. The fuel is abundantly available in the country, but that's still not enough to satisfy the demand for energy in Asia's third-largest economy. For the current financial year, national demand for thermal coal to produce energy has been estimated at 551.6 million tonnes, according to official figures. Of it, at least 84.7 million tonnes is being met through imports, coal minister Piyush Goyal told the Indian parliament in December. The state-run monopoly Coal India Limited (CIL) accounts for more than 80% of the output. Plans by current Prime Minister Narendra Modi for future privatization of the industry faced resistance recently, when CIL workers stopped work in January. The two-day strike -- the biggest of its kind in four decades -- not only severely limited the ability of the companies to meet their production quotas, but forced the government to go slow on reforms.", "Tuberculosis has spread through a Kansas high school after a single case of the disease was discovered. Some 27 people have tested positive for latent TB infection at the school in eastern Kansas. State and county health officials made the announcement on Wednesday after tests were conducted on more than 300 Olathe Northwest High  students and staff who came into contact with a student with TB disease. Officials called people who tested positive on Monday and those with no sign of infection were to receive letters in the mail. One student with TB at Olathe Northwest High School has led to 27 cases of the infection in eastern Kansas among fellow students and staff . According to the Johnson County Department of Heath and Environment, those with TB infection were not contagious, do not feel sick and do not have symptoms. People with TB disease can spread the bacteria to others, feel sick and have symptoms including fever, night sweats, cough and weight loss. Causes:\u00a0Tuberculosis is spread from person to person through the air, when someone infected coughs, sneezes, laughs or sings. A person who breathes in the bacteria can become infected. Symptoms: General symptoms may include feeling weak or sick, weight loss, fever and/or night sweats. Symptoms of TB of the lungs may include coughing, chest pain and/or coughing up blood. Treatment:\u00a0More than 13,000 cases are reported in the U.S. each year. There are also an estimated 10 to 15 million people in the U.S. who are infected with the TB germ, with potential to develop TB disease in the future. If a person gets a TB skin test and it comes back positive, they must take a variety of antibiotics daily for as long as six months. Director of the health department, Lougene Marsh, said: 'The number of individuals with TB infection does not exceed what we would anticipate in this setting.' Tuberculosis can be spread by coughing and sneezing. People with the disease were most likely to spread it to others with whom they have prolonged contact. According to the CDC, TB is caused by a bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis which attacks the lungs but can also infect the kidneys, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, the disease can be fatal. The Department of Heath and Environment said those who tested positive for TB will have a chest x-ray and begin a course of antibiotics to kill the TB bacteria. In May, those who were in the same class as the student with TB disease will be given another round of blood tests as it can sometimes take eight weeks for the bacteria to show itself. A total of 9,582 TB disease cases were reported in the U.S. in 2013 - compared to 84,304 cases when the CDC began records in 1953. The same year, 9 million people around the world became sick with TB disease, leading to 1.5 million deaths.

The 21-year-old's fortunes on the pitch have mirrored that of his team as neither have been able to reproduce the standards of last season, when a brilliant campaign saw the Toffees finish fifth after being in contention for the Champions League for a long period. Barkley has struggled to rediscover the form which made him such an integral part of the team's success but he is working hard to get back to his best. Everton midfielder Ross Barkley has admitted he has failed to replicate last season's performances . Barkley, pictured scoring against Newcastle, has netted just two goals so far this season . 'From my point of view I haven't done as well as I know I can, but things like this happen,' said the England international. 'You have to go through bad days to get to the great days you have in your career. 'Everything's a learning curve. We haven't been going through the best period at the moment but we're going to come through this and be really good at the end of it. 'I don't feel pressure. I believe in myself and I know what I can do. It's not me feeling pressure, it's just me putting pressure on myself if I don't do my best, and I know I can do better. The 21-year-old (right) is expected to start against Italy after coming on in the second half against Lithuania . 'I just focus on getting better every day, putting things right in training and then hopefully what I'm doing right in training I'm going to show in games as well.' Barkley, when he has started, has found himself switching positions regularly and has not been given a long spell behind the centre forward where he was most effective last season. Many observers appear to have pencilled him in for a deeper midfield role but he does not feel that will get the best out of him. 'I'm a striker,' he said. 'I feel I can have my greatest impact there because I'm free to roam around the pitch, take players on, have shots and create chances.'", "Arsenal and Southampton are battling it out over a deal worth \u00a31m for Newcastle keeper Freddie Woodman. The England Under-19, who plays for the national team against France on Tuesday evening as they target a place in the European Championship finals, is one of the biggest prospects in the game.

The powerhouse centre, one of the first names on Stuart Lancaster\u2019s team-sheet when fit, has not featured since October and faces a race against time to be fit for the World Cup in September after suspicions his groin injury was worse than first thought were confirmed by Leicester.

He may or may not play this season.\u2019 England coach Stuart Lancaster (left) has been hit by the news Manu Tuilagi could miss the World Cup . Tuilagi (centre) has a groin injury that could rule him out of England's tournament in September . Fears that Tuilagi's groin injury is worse than first feared were confirmed by his club Leicester . The 23-year-old, who Mailsport understands is suffering from the notoriously troublesome condition known as \u2018Gilmore\u2019s Groin\u2019, is now likely to have just three warm-up matches this summer to prove his fitness ahead of the World Cup, which kicks off on September 18. Leicester, who have conducted a root and branch review of their medical department this season, have repeatedly insisted his return is imminent despite growing rumours the problem is more serious than they have let on. In February Cockerill accused Tuilagi of inadvertently exaggerating the extent of his injury after he gave an interview saying he would not feature in the Six Nations. Tuilagi is considered one of the first names on the England team-sheet when he is fit to play . Tuilagi will try to be fit for the start of England's World Cup campaign, which begins on September 18 . Tuilagi (right) missed the whole of England's Six Nations campaign due to injury . As it transpired, he played no role in tournament, although he did spend time with England\u2019s medical team and remains a valued member of the squad.

Timothy Robenhorst, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, was shocked to find out his son Kayden had been mistreating a classmate, and in response gave him a tough workout, gardening duty and instructions to apologize. For the physically grueling stages of his 5-part punishment, Kayden was dragged out of bed at 4:30am and made to do 50 push-ups on his fists. Spelling it out: Timothy Robenhorst was shocked to heard his son, Kayden, had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him . Next, the boy was tasked with performing ten tougher, incline push-ups, then running a mile. Early-morning Wisconsin temperatures are still routinely below freezing. But Kayden's labors were not over after his hellish morning workout - and the boy is stuck doing landscaping work at two houses his father apparently owns for an unspecified length of time. Punished: Kayden, pictured, was given an array of unpleasant tasks to make up for his wrongs . But the punishment also has an emotional and social aspect - with Kayden also being instructed to apologize to his victim in front of his entire class the day after, which was set to happen Wednesday. Robenhorst then posed for a photograph with his son and a poster spelling out his punishment, and encouraged people to share it. As of Friday night it had been shared more than 1,000 times. He also seemingly insisted that it be posted on Kayden's profile too, where it was set as his profile picture and cover photo. Under the post, Robenhorst wrote: 'I teach my kids they do not start fights but if someone puts their hands on them they finish it. 'This is what happens when you become a bully! I don't put up with it and at 4:30am today my son found out what happens when you pray on people for no reason and bully! 'Please share this to end this behavior everywhere!

A mother who left her 16-month-old daughter alone in a hotel room while she went for a night out with a friend has been given a police caution for neglect. The Mexican woman\u00a0left the Ibis hotel at around 7.30pm when she went to meet a friend and left her child alone until she returned at about 2.30am with a man, the family division of the High Court in London heard. Staff heard the little girl, realised that she was alone and called police. The woman was arrested when she returned to the Ibis, and accepted a caution by police. Her daughter was taken into police protection. Details of the case were revealed as a judge made a ruling on a family court dispute between the parents of the young girl.

He said he had been asked to make decisions on the latest stage of that litigation at a family court hearing. The judge said the woman and the child, now two, had been in England visiting the man at the time of the hotel incident last year. He did not say where the hotel was.

A judge had subsequently barred the woman from removing the child from the jurisdiction of England and Wales following an application by the father, Mr Justice Jackson was told.

She is currently living with her father . He ruled against her after analysing issues relating to the toddler's 'habitual residence'. The judge concluded that the little girl had not been wrongfully retained in England by the father under the terms of an international legal convention.

After all, this was no ordinary monorail car, and Nowak is not your average collector. This was the front cab of an original monorail train that transported millions of visitors throughout Walt Disney World in the 1970s and 1980s. The original Mark IV monorail trains were retired in 1989 to make room for a new generation of models, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Nowak and his wife are Disney fanatics who honeymooned at Disney World and once visited all the Disney parks in the world (minus Paris) in a month. He's also a self-described artist, inventor and collector of \"weird old vehicles,\" including an articulated bus he claims to have transformed into a mobile nightclub. The couple from Chico, California, purchased the cab in 2014, dreaming of the day they might use it to drive their kids to school or bring it to the annual Burning Man festival (Nowak declined to say what he paid for the rail car.) But plans change. Nowak listed the item last week on eBay for $260,000 with a starting bid of $169,000. More than 1,500 people were watching the auction as of Saturday night, though no one had bid. The listing itself was pulled from eBay on Sunday. Nowak, who owns a sound and lighting custom stage design company, had told CNN he and his wife needed the money to fund their next big project, but he declined to provide details. \"My wife and I had plans for it, but we're kind of strapped for cash, so we figured, let's put it out and see what happens.\" The listing provided some insight into what Nowak might have had in mind for the cab. \"Some people have train cars in their back yard, imagine your own monorail guest room, or man cave. Mount it on a bus chassis and drive it around!! Turn it into your kids' ultimate clubhouse,\" the description on the eBay page read. \"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to own a very serious piece of Disney history.\" The listing said the vehicle is available for viewing in Tampa, where Nowak left it with a friend after buying it from a seller in Georgia via eBay last year. CNN could not independently confirm its authenticity. Nowak says he did not receive a title or certificate of authenticity when he purchased the cab but he is confident that it's the real deal. \"I guess there's chance it could be a reproduction, but I'm not too worried,\" he said. The listing promised free shipping, but Nowak is not sure that he's ready to part with the item. \"I'm sure I'd have salty taste in my mouth if it gets sold, but we'll see what happens,\" he said. \"If this thing gets sold, I know that in 20 years, I'll look back and think that of all the things I got rid of, this is the coolest.\"", "(CNN)Personal details including the passport numbers of U.S. President Barack Obama and 19 other world leaders at last year's G20 summit were inadvertently released by Australia's immigration department, British newspaper the Guardian reported Monday.

You love it, you want to be out there, but it\u2019s very important that you pay attention to what goes on when you get a concussion.' 'There are a lot of issues that stem from brain injuries and it's not just professional athletes. This affects everybody,' Weatherford said.

The fall occurs right as the doors are closing the the train is preparing to leave the station. Unsteady: This is the moment the apparently intoxicated man (left) loses his balances and goes to fall into the cap between the two carriages . Fall: The video shows the passenger falling straight into the space between the connected carriages . Down: The man slips straight into the gap, as fellow passengers (right) watch on with shock . As the man falls, shocked onlookers try to help, only to realize the train is alighting. One man can be seen in the video panicking and holding his hands in the air. However, one the train passes and people scurry to the platform's edge, believing a tragedy has just occurred, they suddenly see the man get to his feet and continue stumbling. He somehow fell into the zone outside of the rails known as the 'area of refuge'. The fellow passengers quickly pull the man up to the platform. Police arrived to assist the man. He suffered only minor injuries from the fall. Safe: People on the platform can be seen pulling the man back up onto the station after the train departs . Perhaps more startling is the fact that incidents such as these happen every week, according to a Metro spokesman.

Kurdish peshmerga forces claim to have accidentally killed Doiron in a friendly fires incident, after mistaking him for an Islamic militant . A Canadian special forces soldier was killed in a friendly fire incident after he and others ignored an order to stay in their car and showed up to the front line unannounced, a spokesman for Iraq's Kurdish forces said Sunday. The death Friday of Sgt. Andrew Joseph Doiron marked Canada's first casualty as part of the U.S.-led coalition's war on the extremist Islamic State group. Canadian officials could not be immediately reached for comment Sunday on the peshmerga claim, though Canada's defense minister previously acknowledged Doiron's death came as a result of 'a case of mistaken identity.' Peshmerga spokesman Halgurd Hekmat said a group of Canadian soldiers showed up unannounced Friday to the village of Bashiq, in Iraq's Nineveh province near the militant-held city of Mosul. The area had seen heavy fighting against Islamic State militants the previous day. 'When they returned, the peshmerga asked them to identify themselves,' Hekmat told The Associated Press. 'They answered in Arabic, that's when peshmerga started shooting. It was their fault.' Hekmat added that he doesn't know why the Canadians were there. 'I consider it an improper action by the Canadians and illogical,' he said. Two Kurdish officials later told the AP that Doiron's body was flown to Canada early Sunday following a military ceremony at Irbil International Airport. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to brief journalists. Canada's defense department on Saturday announced the death of Doiron, a soldier in the Canadian Special Operations Regiment based at Garrison Petawawa, Ontario. Three other Canadian soldiers were wounded in the incident and are in stable condition, Canadian Defense Minister Jason Kenney said. Sgt Doiron and other soldiers were shot when they unexpectedly showed up at the front line in Bashiq, Iraq on Friday. Bashiq is located not far from the ISIS stronghold city of Mosul . Canada has 69 special forces soldiers with Kurdish peshmerga fighters in what the government calls an advising and assisting role. They were sent to help train Kurdish fighters last September in a mission that was billed as noncombat with the elite troops working far behind the front lines . The fact that Canadian special forces have been training and assisting on the front lines and directing airstrikes has stirred controversy in the country, but Kenney said the rules of engagement will remain the same. Kenney said Doiron's death had 'nothing to do with combat,' saying it was a case of mistaken identity on the part of Kurdish fighters at night. 'It was caused by a failure of identification. There will be an inquiry,' Kenney said. The Islamic State group currently holds a third of Iraq and Syria. The U.S.-led coalition began airstrikes targeting the extremists in August. So far, four other troops have been killed as part of the coalition, not counting Iraqi forces. They include a U.S. Marine presumed lost at sea in October, a Marine killed in a noncombat incident in Baghdad in October, a U.S. Air Force pilot killed in December when his jet crashed in Jordan and a captive Jordanian pilot burned to death in a cage by the Islamic State group.", "Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on Anderlecht teenagers Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker.

Bosses at the Palace Museum in the city have begun a crackdown on the popular phone accessories over fears that one wrong move could cause lasting damage to the invaluable artifacts in the ancient palace houses. The People's Daily Online reports that eagle-eyed staff are keeping watch over photo-enthusiasts in the palace's narrow or crowded areas, as well as all the indoor exhibitions, to avoid any potentially costly accidents. Ban: The Forbidden City has said selfie sticks are no longer allowed inside the exhibition rooms or narrow passageways over concerns an unfortunate accident may occur . 'Selfie sticks will cause safety concerns, whether for tourists or the exhibits,' Shen Lixia, deputy director of the museum's tourist reception department, told China Daily. 'It may touch the glass exhibition case and cause damage to the cultural relics.' She added that as well as being banned in exhibition areas, the sticks would be banned in outdoor areas of the museum - so visitors would be wise not to bother taking them at all. However, the sticks will still be allowed outside the palace in the Forbidden City - so tourists can still get the all-important shot of the famous 15th century building in the background. There was speculation that the move could be the first step to a total ban, as has been implemented at other cultural attractions around the world. It is thought the Louvre in Paris will bring in a ban in the next few weeks, while several football stadiums have banned them over fears the extendable devices could be used as a weapon. But it seems should the Forbidden City instill a total ban in mobile-mad China - there are said to be 19,300 versions of the selfie stick available on the country's answer to eBay, Taobao - they would have a fair amount of support. Popular: Chinese tourists use 'selfie sticks' to take pictures as they stand on Jingshan Park, overlooking the Forbidden City, in February. There are more than 19,000 versions of the sticks for sale on Taobao .

Police chiefs have been urged to wind up the hunt for Madeleine McCann as detectives battle the terror threat and a spate of murders. A team of 31 British detectives are working exclusively to find the girl, who vanished from her parents\u2019 holiday apartment in Portugal eight years ago. The Metropolitan Police was tasked with investigating the disappearance after her family made a personal plea to David Cameron in 2011. Yet despite costing the taxpayer \u00a310million and dozens of trips by officers to the Algarve, the inquiry \u2013 codenamed Operation Grange \u2013 has not led to a single arrest. Now a senior police union leader has called for the probe to be axed and the detectives reassigned to other investigations in the UK. He says officers in London are bemused why they are working round-the-clock fighting the threat from Islamic State-inspired jihadists and solve at least 14 murders since Christmas while the Operation Grange detectives are barred from helping. Metropolitan Police Federation chairman John Tully said: \u2018It is time to re-focus on what we need to do to keep London safe. We no longer have the resources to conduct specialist inquiries all over the world which have nothing to do with London. \u2019The Met has long been seen as the last resort for investigations others have struggled with elsewhere. \u2018It is surprising to see an inquiry like the McCann investigation ring-fenced. I have heard a few rumblings of discontent about it from lots of sources. \u2018When the force is facing a spike in murder investigations it is not surprising there is resentment of significant resources diverted to a case that has no apparent connection with London.\u2019 Even though Madeleine\u2019s parents Kate, 47, and Gerry, 46, live in Rothley, Leicestershire, Scotland Yard was handed the investigation because of its expertise in investigating complex murder case. Police chiefs \u2018ring-fenced\u2019 the inquiry to prevent officers working on other case, even though the force has been forced to make \u00a3600million in cuts over four years. Operation Grange was set up to review the original Portuguese police probe into the disappearance of Madeleine, then three, from the family\u2019s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007. The Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into Maddie's disappearance after her parents, pictured above, made a personal plea to PM David Cameron in 2011 . After the Portuguese inquiry was shelved as \u2018unsolved\u2019, the McCanns, who remain convinced their daughter is alive, appealed to Mr Cameron for assistance. Since the girl, who would now be 11, vanished, every possible theory has been explored, including that she was kidnapped by a paedophile, killed during a botched burglary and her body dumped, snatched by traffickers and sold to a childless couple and that she wandered out of the apartment and died in a tragic accident. However, not one shred of proof of what happened to Madeleine has been uncovered. Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, who took over Operation Grange in December, and her team ravelled to Portugal to interview seven suspects and four witnesses, but have not released any information about what they discovered. A Met Police spokesman said: \u2018There are 31 officers working on Operation Grange. Their sole investigation is the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.\u2019", "Tourism Thailand\u2019s latest effort to lure holidaymakers to its idyllic beaches and ancient temples may have backfired after a marketing campaign featured a creepy \u2018stalker\u2019 video.

On the track, Mercedes were considerably faster than their opponents in 2015 and early signs suggest the same will be true this season. Hamilton, though, is eager for competition. Speaking to Laureus.com, he said: 'I like to race, I really like to race. The 2015 cars are going to be evolutions of last year's cars, so it'll be the same people that we were racing with last year. Red Bull, Williams, and then you're hoping that it's a bit of a better year for those like McLaren and Ferrari, so that we have more people to race. The more the merrier. 'There was one year the first seven races were won by a different driver, a different team, that's what people want to see. But, most importantly, if the cars are close you can have real races where you're overtaking and battling and that's what I love doing. That's what racing's about.'

But despite the seemingly attractive offer, Britain's poultry industry is struggling to recruit and is now facing a staff shortage that is threatening exports. The problem, according to one industry chief, lies in the nature of the job: sexers spend 12 hours a day 'staring at the backside of a chick'. And each new recruit must spend three years learning how to do it. Scroll down for video . Chicken sexers: Workers spot the 'minuscule differences' in the size and shape of each one-day-old chick's genitalia - known as its 'vent' - to determine whether it will be a rooster, or will one day lay eggs . Andrew Large, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, added that another part of the problem is that the awareness of the role is not as high as it could be. Each future 'chick sexer' receives years in training in how to spot 'minuscule differences' in the size and shape of a newly-hatched chick's genitalia to determine whether it will be a rooster or a hen. They are expected to be able to sort between 800 and 1,200 day-old old chicks an hour - between three and five seconds a chick - with an accuracy of 97 or 98 per cent. This must be done for as long as it takes to fill an order, which can be up to 13 hours. And each chick must have its genitalia - known as its 'vent' - checked without being harmed, Mr Large told\u00a0The Times. Delicate: Each chick must be handled with care . Although the checking technique can be taught relatively quickly, the ability to maintain standards for such long periods at such level of intensity has to be developed over a longer time. In 2013 the industry failed to recruit a single 'vent chick sexer' and asked for the job to be added to an official government list of occupations with staff shortages. Mr Large told The Times: 'It takes three years to train someone so they \u00a0develop the sensitivity and dexterity to reliably sex the bird and a lot of people don't want to spend that amount of time training. 'I think the problem is the job itself. You are spending hours every day staring at the backside of a chick. That is not seen as being attractive. 'In southeast Asia a chick sexer is a high status job. In the UK it is more likely to be the butt of humour.' There are an estimated 100 to 150 chick sexers in the country but a shortage of 15 workers means the industry risks losing overseas clients. But the Migration Management Committee, who advises the government on whether a job should be added to the shortage list, ruled that chick sexing should not be included. Chick sexing has previously made headlines as a number of the birds - mainly male - are discarded and killed if they are surplus to the requirement of the order. When asked by MailOnline whether this could affect the number of jobseekers applying for jobs as chick sexers, Mr Large said it was not an issue that had been raised with them. He added that it was only if the birds did not fit the order, and could not be redirected to meat production, that they were 'humanely culled'. Waiting to be checked: Chick sexers are expected to be able to sort between 800 and 1,200 day-old old chicks an hour - between three and five seconds a chick - with an accuracy of 97 or 98 per cent .", "Rival fire brigades who turned up to tackle the same blaze started fighting over who should put it out - before police turned up and joined in the brawl. The conflict unfolded when firemen from Mexico's Heroic Fire Department and Ceda Fire Department were dispatched to deal with the brush fire in the capital Mexico City. But tempers frayed when both sides disagreed over who should deal with the situation and a fight broke out. Scroll down for video . Violence: Police arrived to break up a fight between rival fire brigades in Mexico City - only to end up becoming involved in the brawl . Passer-by Atanasio Rivas Matos, 25, who captured the conflict on his mobile phone, said: 'One of the groups of firemen started spraying the other group with water, who retaliated by throwing bricks at them. 'And then the police arrived.' But rather than calming the situation down, the appearance of the officers seemed to fuel the conflict and the firemen quickly turned on the police. Matos said: 'It was really bizarre. Flash point: Officers were brought in to ease tensions, but had to defend themselves after being attacked by fire fighters . 'The police were trying to separate the two groups when they came under attack from the firemen who started punching them, and then more policemen who turned up to stop the fighting were also attacked. 'It was like something out of a very bad comedy.' Now furious city officials have demanded an explanation. A spokesman for the council said: 'This was appalling behaviour from those we employ to safeguard the city. 'Instead of behaving like public officials they behaved like children in a playground. 'An investigation is underway and we will not stop until we have got to the bottom of what went on.' Meanwhile both fire brigades have blamed each other for the fracas and the attack on police. A police spokesman said: 'We are assisting the city in their investigation.'", "Lawrence Okoye is set for the next step  in his NFL career. Since swapping the discus for the defensive line, mentor Jim Tomsula said the 6ft 6in man mountain has  adapted to the sport well, but is set to face a steep learning curve in his third year with the San Francisco 49ers. 'The development has been significant. But he\u2019s playing a position that\u2019s not like anything else that he\u2019s done. So everything is completely brand new and that\u2019s a hard transition.' 'This year, he's going to be in there against guys that are going to make the other team. Let's see where we're at,' head coach Tomsula said at the NFL owners meeting. Lawrence Okoye faces a battle to make the 53-man roster and Jim Tomsula is keen to know where he stands . Jim Tomsula spoke about Lawrence Okoye's future and was gushing about Jarryd Hayne's NFL hopes . After signing as an undrafted free agent in 2013, Okoye's first year in the Bay Area was injury-hit. Last season he played against third and fourth-stringers in pre-season before being signed to the practice squad. Despite Tomsula's expertise as a defensive line coach, 23-year-old former Olympian Okoye faces a battle to make the 49ers final 53-man roster due to enormous depth at the position. Even without the likes of Justin Smith and Ray McDonald, Tomsula reckons it's the best positional group he's had in his eight years with the franchise. Tomsula also spoke of fellow NFL-convert Jarryd Hayne, who joined the 49ers from Australia's NRL as a free agent earlier this month. The 49ers plan to use Hayne as a running back but Tomsula would not rule out using him as a returner, and spoke of his excitement at working with the 27-year-old. 'He\u2019s a guy used to being downfield catching a ball with people running at him,' Tomsula said. 'He\u2019s used to making tackles in open spaces. You\u2019ve got a guy used to carrying the ball, catching the ball and avoiding. Obviously, with the explosive qualities that he has, you can\u2019t help but be excited.'", "The Supreme Court has given a former UPS driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duties while she was pregnant. On a 6-3 vote, the justices on Wednesday revived Peggy Young's discrimination claim against UPS and sent the case back to a lower court. The case concerned employers' responsibilities under the 37-year-old Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Atlanta-based UPS maintained that it obeyed the law because it provided light-work duty only in limited situations and did not single out pregnant women. Peggy Young (pictured in December last year), a Virginia woman who lost her UPS job because she became pregnant, speaks to reporters outside the Supreme Court in Washington, DC. The Supreme Court is giving the former UPS driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duty when she was pregnant . But the company changed its policy as of January and said it now tries to accommodate pregnant workers. The justices gave Young another chance to litigate whether UPS should have granted her request for temporary changes in work duties - she asked not to lift heavier packages - after she became pregnant in 2006. Writing on behalf of the majority, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said the lower court is required to determine if the employer had 'legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpretextual justification' for treating employees differently. Breyer said the lower court failed to consider the effects of UPS policies that covered non-pregnant workers who might have disabilities, injuries or otherwise might need accommodations, and asked, 'Why, when the employer accommodated so many, could it not accommodate pregnant women as well?' Breyer said there is a 'genuine dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from Young's'. The outcome reflects a 'middle ground' that Justice Elena Kagan suggested during arguments in early December. Courts must now re-examine Young's case with a more accepting view of the discrimination claim. A federal district court judge and an appeals court had ruled in favor of UPS, which was backed by business groups in the case. The two sides in the case disagreed over whether UPS agreed to accommodate non-pregnant workers requesting light-duty assignments. UPS and other employers facing similar suits still are able to argue their policies were legal because they were based on seniority or some other acceptable reason. The case concerned whether the package delivery company violated a federal law, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, by denying Young's request. Young, who worked at a Maryland facility, had acted on a midwife's advice that she not be required to lift packages weighing more than 20 pounds (9 kg). Young, now 43, said she dealt almost exclusively with overnight letters, but UPS said its drivers must be able to lift packages weighing up to 70 pounds. Young left the company in 2009. The Virginia woman lost two rounds in lower courts. UPS has since changed its policy, and now says it will try to accommodate pregnant workers. Nine states also have adopted laws directing employers to do so. In recent months, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has updated guidance to employers to make clear that they should accommodate people in Young's situation. Yet the U.S. Postal Service said it has made no change in policy and maintains the practice that UPS has now abandoned. Supporters of Peggy Young, a Virginia woman who lost her UPS job because she became pregnant, attend a rally outside the Supreme Court in DC in December. The justices found in Young's favor on Wednesday .", "Aberdeenshire, Scotland (CNN)The Scottish Highlands on a wintry morning in January made for an awe-inspiring interview setting. We traveled along narrow roads winding among snow-capped mountains, eventually arriving at Birkhall -- the Scottish home to Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. I had pitched for interviews with the couple several times over the years and finally Prince Charles accepted. I wanted to speak to them about their 10 years of marriage and their upcoming U.S. tour. The couple's first tour as newlyweds was also to the United States, so it felt like an appropriate moment to take stock. When you reach the house, it strikes you as an idyllic royal hideaway. It has the sense of a castle but is welcoming like a farmhouse. It has a pinkish hue and green window frames that take in the stunning views. We went in the back entrance and were escorted through the house to the dining room at the front where we set things up. Rarely have cameras been allowed in, and never to this part of the house. As we were getting ready, an aide announced someone wanted to say hello. The Duchess of Cornwall appeared from around the corner, keen to welcome the crew. We spoke about what all Brits talk about -- the weather. Prince Charles opens up about love and life . She is not what you might expect when you meet her. She's more charismatic, which is something I hope comes across in the CNN special, \"Spotlight: Charles and Camilla.\" Unfortunately she had declined our request to be interviewed. She's never done one and doesn't plan to. She wants the limelight to be on her husband. The Duchess of Cornwall had however allowed our cameras to get close enough to pick up sound during some of her public appearances. That would give viewers a greater sense of her character than they had had before. When Prince Charles arrived, he also insisted on meeting the crew, which was great but was also eating into our interview time. In the end, we had the full 20 minutes as planned. You can make your own judgements of the TV special, but I think we did manage to give you a good sense of him. He was comfortable enough to be himself. He was the same person on camera as off.  Afterward, we walked through the house and into the garden for some additional shots. The Duchess of Cornwall joined us on the way and was worried I would be cold without a coat, but the coat was inaccessible and I didn't want to hold things up. You can't tell an awful lot about someone by spending just a morning with them, particularly as a journalist, but my impression was that they are close, connected and have fun. I then left them to take a stroll on their own with the crew, who captured some shots that I think have a small place in royal history -- a glimpse of a couple enjoying each other's company in their private wilderness, before he ascends to the throne.", "Rob Biddulph's picture book Blown Away has won Waterstones Children's Book Prize . It took him almost five years to find a publisher, but last night Rob Biddulph's persistence paid off when his first children's book won a major award. Blown Away, the magazine art director's enchanting tale about a sky-faring penguin, won the \u00a35,000 Waterstones Children's Book Prize. It is only the second time a picture book has triumphed during the award's 11-year history. Mr Biddulph, who works for The Observer, said last night: 'I'm totally surprised at winning. It took me a while to get this book published.' Melissa Cox, chairman of the judging panel, said the author had 'a beautiful fresh style all his own'. She said: 'The test of a good picture book is not how good it is on first reading, but how enjoyable it is on its fiftieth. 'It's a beautiful fresh style that is all his own and his style of storytelling is very reminiscent of classic picture book writers like Allan Ahlberg. 'It's very unusual for a brand new illustrator to write their own text, which marked it out, and even more unusual is for them to do rhyming text.' Mr Biddulph began as an author by making up stories for his three children and illustrating them. Blown Away was named the overall winner beating two other titles which had triumphed in their categories \u2013 Half Bad by Sally Green, the best teenage book, and Murder Most Unladylike by Robin Stevens, the best title for younger readers. Waterstones Managing director James Daunt said: 'This year we have another wonderfully inspiring Prize that is testament to the extraordinary vibrancy and creativity in children's publishing.' Penguins also captured the public imagination in the build-up to Christmas last year when the computer-generated Monty starred in the John Lewis ad campaign, with spin-off cuddly toys selling out. Sally Green (pictured) was crowned winner of the best book for teenagers with her debut Half Bad .", "When fitness guru Kayla Itsines announced a free Australian boot camp, thousands travelled to the major cities to take part.

Why wait? If anything, replays are detracting from the excitement of the competition, and the format of what is currently the Capital One Cup is an anomaly. It should not take FIFA\u2019s monstrous destruction of football\u2019s calendar to make the English game see sense. By chance, there were no replays in the FA Cup fifth round this year and they were not missed. The great Cup shocks of this campaign have all happened on the day, inside 90 minutes. David Gill suggested removing cup replays, and he has a point, even if it it has taken Qatar to make it happen . Cambridge United were excellent to earn a replay against Manchester United, but lost the second game . That is when Bradford City beat Chelsea and Sunderland, when Middlesbrough eliminated Manchester City, when Blackburn Rovers beat Swansea City then Stoke City. A few lower division tussles aside, all the games that went to replays went with form. Manchester United defeated Cambridge United, Sunderland won at Fulham, Liverpool came from behind to beat Bolton Wanderers and Southampton won against Ipswich Town. Replays favour the bigger teams anyway. If Cambridge could have taken Manchester United to extra-time, and maybe to penalties, on a crummy pitch at a boisterous Abbey Stadium, who knows what might have happened? Heading to a decider at Old Trafford, their moment had passed. Jonathan Stead's goal against Chelsea was part of a shock that re-affirmed the FA Cup's giant killing tradition . Bradford celebrate their win at Stamford Bridge, and didn't need a replay to upset the Premier League leaders . We cling to tradition, but tradition had teams playing replay after replay until they could be separated. Those encounters had an epic feel. In 1979, Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday needed five matches \u2014 including three that went to extra-time \u2014 lasting nine hours before they could be torn apart. The second replay ended 2-2, the third 3-3. Arsenal won the fourth 2-0. That is the true gladiatorial tradition of the FA Cup, but it is unthinkable with modern fixture congestion. So as the shoot-out that completes the first replay is in itself a compromise, why is it needed at all? Middlesbrough also caused an upset, by beating Manchester City, but replays rarely lead to shocks . Smaller clubs might be better rewarded if games were decided on the night by a penalty shoot-out . A game decided on the day, one hit, with extra-time and penalties, would go some way to restoring tension and drama. When the FA has to alter its company accounts because the FA Cup sponsorship deal confidently included by former general secretary Alex Horne has not materialised, it is ridiculous to pretend the current format is a winner. The same with the League Cup. It is decided over one game in every round, then two in the semi-finals, and back to one for the final. What is the point of that? Better to have consistency and let the calendar breathe a little. It should not need FIFA\u2019s selfishness to be a catalyst for reform in the English game. The time to change is now.", "Trying to find a way to explain the birds and the bees to children can be a difficult task for any parent. So luckily for this father, a pair of raccoons took it upon themselves to make his job a little easier by giving a little demonstration in the garden. The hilarious footage captured in Seattle begins innocently enough with some excited children looking out of the window at two raccoons scaling their fence. The children watch on excitedly as the male raccoon chases the female from the fence and into the garden . As the youngsters speculate about whether they will jump from the fence \u2013 before a little \u2018muffin man\u2019 song interlude \u2013 one of the raccoons descends into the garden closely pursued by the other. One child, sensing the tension, asks: \u2018Can raccoons fight?\u2019 While another exclaims: \u2018Woah, they\u2019re wrestling.\u2019 As one raccoon mates the other, the children begin to laugh and the father responds quickly be saying: \u2018They\u2019re doing more than wrestling I think.\u2019 Laughing along in the excitement, the father continues to film the episode in the garden until one of the children offers up an explanation in the form of a question: \u2018Is he doing the Heimlich manoeuvre?\u2019 The children laugh hysterically as the two raccoons begin mating and offer up a number of innocent explanations for their behaviour . \u2018I think so,\u2019 replies one of the children before the father confidently states: \u2018Yes, that\u2019s the Heimlich.\u2019 Raccoons usually mate between late January and mid-March, in a period triggered by increasing daylight. During the mating season, males spend much of their time searching for females in an attempt to copulate in the three-to-four day period when conception is possible. The encounters can last over and hour and may be repeated over several nights, so it is likely that the children have some laughs still yet to come. The Heimlich manoeuvre? Raccoon copulation can last over an hour so it is likely the children had some more laughs later .", "Aaron Ramsey has added his name to Francis Coquelin's long list of admirers at Arsenal and says that the Gunners' man at the base of midfield helps the rest of the team to 'tick'. Coquelin is enjoying an impressive breakthrough campaign in Arsene Wenger's side, finding a way into the first team after returning from a loan spell at Championship side Charlton Athletic in December. And with many Arsenal fans crediting Coquelin with their team's impressive recent form that has moved them into contention for the Barclays Premier League title, Ramsey has also endorsed the theory that the Frenchman has become a key cog in midfield. Francis Coquelin has been impressive in midfield for Arsenal in their recent run of form in the Premier League . The French midfielder has been an ever-present figure for Arsene Wenger's side in the league in 2015 so far . Aaron Ramsey says Coquelin's defensive presence in midfield gives his team-mates more freedom to play . Arsenal have won their last six games in the Premier League and are now just a point behind second-placed Manchester City, with Coquelin - yet to miss a league game in 2015 - providing his midfield colleagues with more freedom to go forward. 'He's been really good,' Ramsey said. 'He's very aggressive and doesn't give the opposition much time on the ball, and that's why he wins so many tackles. Then he wins the ball and makes us tick over. 'It's been really good to see his development this year, he's had a superb couple of months now so hopefully he can continue that. Coquelin attempts to win an aerial ball ahead of Ramsey during a training session earlier in the season . Coquelin was part of the Arsenal side that almost turned around a 3-1 first-leg deficit against Monaco . 'It is quite comforting knowing that one of the midfielders is behind you in position, thinking more defensively. It is something that he does really well.' Ramsey was left out of the starting XI for Arsenal's Champions League exit to Monaco last week and he feels there is more competition than ever for places in Wenger's in-form side. 'There\u2019s definitely a fight for our places,' he told Arsenal Player. 'Everyone is keeping each other on their toes - it\u2019s good that we have that strength in depth now.' Wenger now sees Coquelin as a key part of his team after initially loaning him out to Charlton earlier in the year .", "Johan Cruyff  labelled Holland's performance during Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Turkey in their Euro 2016 qualifier 'a disgrace' - but manager Guus Hiddink insists he does not fear for his job.

'I don't have the feeling that they (the Dutch Football Association, the KNVB) want to sack me and I still have a lot of fun in my job. There is nothing going on.' Pressure on Hiddink had earlier been heightened after Cruyff's damning verdict on the performance against Turkey. 'Holland were terrible against Turkey. Nobody did what they had to do,' Cruyff wrote in his column in\u00a0De Telegraaf. 'The defenders were only passing the ball to the midfielders and they then passed it back to the defenders,' he added. 'The people with little creativity were dictating play. This is not what you want. The problems only got bigger.' Holland have the opportunity to make amends when they host Spain on Tuesday in a friendly which sees the two sides meet for the first time since the Dutch routed the then World Cup holders 5-1 at the 2014 tournament in Brazil.

Laura Abraham told the New York Post\u00a0that when she tried to break up with the multimillionaire lawyer, he suggested that she should round up several male friends and have an orgy. She claims the attorney said he wanted to watch her have sex with multiple men at once. 'He wanted me to be a live porno star in front of him. ...I told him that\u2019s not something I ever fantasized about,' she told the newspaper. Sanford Rubenstein, a prominent civil rights attorney who works with Rev. Al Sharpton, was accused of rape in October, but later cleared . She also claims that Rubenstein tried to give her money to buy drugs for her to take - but she refused. Abraham says her romance with Rubenstein was unfolding as he was defending himself against accusations he had raped an unconscious Macy's executive after taking her home from his pal Rev. Al Sharpton's birthday party in October. Rubenstein, who won tens of millions of dollars pursuing police brutality lawsuits with the help of Sharpton, was cleared in January after investigators concluded there was not enough evidence to charge him. Rubenstein vehemently denied the rape allegations and said the sex was consensual. Abraham says she met Rubenstein in November and finally ended things last week. She says they occasionally shared a bed - but that she never had sex with him. Through his attorney Ben Brafman, Rubenstein confirmed to the Post that he had a 'brief personal relationship' with Abraham. However, he called Abraham's allegations 'ridiculous' and 'patently false.' Brafman referred to Abraham as a 'scorned woman.' Rubenstein and Abraham were pictured together at a hotel in South Beach in Miami at the end of February. She says that she never was sexually attracted to him - but that she met him once a week for dinner or to hang out at his Manhattan apartment. She says his indecent proposal came around Valentine's Day when she tried to end things. 'He said, \"It\u2019s OK if you don\u2019t want to be exclusive anymore, because I would love to see you have sex with multiple men at the same time...\"' she told the Post. Despite turning him down, Abraham continued to see the wealthy septuagenarian lawyer. She claims the final straw came when he encouraged her to do molly - the potent powdered form of the party drug MDMA - and tried to give her cash so she could buy it. She claims he wanted her to get high so he could 'have his way' with her.", "Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has furiously denied talk of a problem between himself and assistant manager Ryan Giggs and has absolved defender Jonny Evans of any blame in the spitting incident with Newcastle's Papiss Cisse on Wednesday night. United win 1-0 at St James Park on Wednesday was notable for the fact Giggs did not appear keen to celebrate Ashley Young's late winner. Van Gaal said on Thursday: 'I am very irritated with this question. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal insisted he and assistant Ryan Giggs (left) are on good terms . The Dutchman refuted claims that there were problems between himself and the former United player . Giggs (left) appeared subdued after Ashley Young scored a late winner against Newcastle on Wednesday . 'Everybody can see we have a good relationship. 'We work very hard together me with the players and the staff. 'I am very irritated about this. I am not pleased. A suggestion about a poor relationship is wrong. 'I am a fact man.' Minutes before Thursday's press conference, United defender Evans had denied spitting at Cisse on Wednesday night in a statement released by the club. Cisse, on the other hand, has apologised for his actions. Jonny Evans (left) and Papiss Cisse clash after the unsavoury incident at St James' Park on Wednesday night . Cisse has apologised to Evans after reacting while the Man United defender has denied all allegations . Van Gaal said: 'I have spoken with Jonny and that is why I am late. 'When he was spitting on the ground maybe it was a human reaction. It was not his intention and I believe him.' The FA are waiting for referee Anthony Taylor's report. As he missed the incident between Jonny Evans and Pappis Cisse, it is unlikely the it will be included in his report - meaning the FA can retrospectively punish the pair. Hull striker George Boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, the FA have issued new guidelines to move in line with new FIFA guidelines meaning Evans and Cisse could now be banned for six games. Asked about whether he feared the FA would charge Evans, Van Gaal replied briefly. He said: 'I think the FA is very wise.' Evans released a statement on Thursday, denying the allegations that he spat at the Newcastle striker. The\u00a0statement on Manchester United's official website read:\u00a0'Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night's match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse. 'I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting. 'It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.' Conversely, Papiss Cisse\u00a0has said since apologised to his team-mates, fans, and even Evans, saying he spat back at the Northern Irishman as a reaction to something 'very unpleasant.'", "If history and a tilt at the career grand slam at the Masters seems a world away for Rory McIlroy amidst the water torture of Doral, then this is the week when it will all come into blessed focus. Forget the frustrated figure he cut on Friday when he created a YouTube highlight with his highland toss of his three iron into one of the many hazards that give the Blue Monster its name. This week it will all feel like stale news when he makes the ultimate golfing road trip. How does a couple of days behind closed doors at Augusta sound, with your dad for company, a couple of mates, a club member who knows all the course secrets and an athlete who is even more celebrated in America than the world No1? Rory McIlroy plays a shot on the sixth at the\u00a0the WGC-Cadillac Championship on Saturday . McIlroy plans to link up with four-time Super Bowl champion\u00a0Tom Brady at Augusta . All that awaits the 25-year-old as he combines a bit of rest and recreation with a touch of sharp prep work with the first major of the season now just a month away. \u2018To be honest, Augusta National is probably even nicer without the crowds than it is during the Masters, so it\u2019s going to be a great experience,\u2019 he said. The much-decorated athlete? None other than Tom Brady, quarterback with the New England Patriots and a four-time Super Bowl champion. He has played Augusta once before and shot a 77, so he is clearly no mean competitor. For a massive fan of virtually every sport like McIlroy, the appeal of linking up with Brady is obvious. As for the club member, Jeff Knox accompanied McIlroy when he was first man out in the third round of the Masters last year. Acting as marker, the 52 year old actually outscored him shooting 70 to McIlroy\u2019s 71, with the latter describing Knox\u2019s performance on the greens as \u2018the best I have ever seen at Augusta\u2019. World No 1 McIlroy threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on Friday . It is not rocket science, therefore, as to why McIlroy would seek him out in a more friendly setting in an attempt to pick his brain. At the season\u2019s first major, McIlroy will be attempting to complete not only the career grand slam but a third major victory in a row, following his successes in The Open and the USPGA last year. As for Doral and the WGC-Cadillac Championship, McIlroy began his third round yesterday eight shots adrift of the leader JB Holmes. He actually made up three strokes on Holmes on Friday despite his three iron following his golf ball into the water at the par-five eighth. McIlroy played a lot better once he had let off steam, with the result that there were only nine players ahead of him at the halfway stage. Among them were some powerful hitters, including Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson and Bubba Watson. Welshman Jamie Donaldson was ninth. Australian Adam Scott turned in a remarkable opening two rounds to be just three off the lead. The Australian was not only playing his first tournament for three months, he was using a standard-length putter for the first time in four years.", "France head coach Philippe Saint-Andre reverted to his favoured halfback pairing of Sebastien Tillous-Borde and Camille Lopez when he named them on Thursday in a reshuffled team to face Italy in the Six Nations on Sunday.

The likes of Sergio Aguero, Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta wore pained expressions as they left Manchester airport following their humbling at the Nou Cup.

Aguero had a penalty saved in the 78th minute that would have made the closing stages more interesting, but the reality is that Barcelona threatened to humiliate the Barclays Premier League champions only for a heroic goalkeeping performance from Hart. The squad returned to Manchester late on Thursday evening after they remained in Barcelona overnight and held a session at Espanyol's training ground earlier in the day. The players were given no time to mull over their European exit after they were taught a lesson over two legs by Lionel Messi and Co. Manuel Pellegrini has been beaten four times by Barcelona since becoming Manchester City manager . After such a commanding performance by the La Liga leaders captain Vincent Kompany was forced to admit that Manchester City are still a long way behind the very best in Europe. 'The reality is they were a better team, there is no shame in admitting that. For me there is a big, big difference.

Linda Lira, 31, is facing four years in jail after she was arrested at Lemon Grove Academy in San Diego yesterday for locking a group of nine to 11-year-olds into a classroom. Police initially thought Lira, who is from San Diego, had taken hallucinogenic drugs, but tests came back negative and her lawyers now say she was trying to protect the children from demons. Linda Lira, 31, was arrested yesterday after locking a group of nine to 11-year-olds into a classroom, then fighting with school staff as they tried to free the youngsters, while 'undressing and dressing repeatedly' Police initially thought Lira, who is facing four years behind bars, had taken drugs, but test came back negative and her lawyers now say she locked the room because she thought demons were outside . The strange incident began in a classroom at Lemon Grove yesterday at around 4pm when Lira began 'acting bizarre' before locking herself and a group of students inside a room. One child was slapped an two others pushed to the floor when they tried to escape, suffering minor injuries, as Lira began barricading the door. The quick-thinking youngsters used Lira's unguarded campus radio to call for help, and when other staff arrived and broke into the room, Lira began fighting with them. The children managed to slip out of the room, leaving Lira behind, at which point she began 'undressing and dressing repeatedly', according to one Sheriff's Deputy. She was initially arrested for 14 counts each of child endangerment and false imprisonment, but this was later revised to three charges of false imprisonment and one of resisting arrest. The incident happened yesterday at Lemon Grove Academy (pictured). Lawyers say they are still trying to piece together exactly what happened, but think the breakdown was triggered by something in Lira's past . Today defense attorney Corey Wlodarczyk said Lira had suffered a 'breakdown' inside the classroom, telling NBC 7 that she 'suffers from emotional issues'. While Mr Wlodarczyk said he is still trying to piece together exactly what happened, he said the behavior was 'uncharacteristic' of Lira, and was likely triggered by something in her past. He added that Lira was scared, having never been arrested before, and said she was taking her ordeal 'one day at a time'. The suspect\u2019s sister, Cathy Lira, said her sibling had been making some strange comments about Lucifer and warriors guarding her in recent weeks, but declined to say more.

He also criticized a letter sent by 47 U.S. Republican senators to Iran's leaders, which threatened to scupper any deal if a Republican President is elected next year, Iran's official Press TV reported. \"Of course, I'm concerned because the other side is into deception, trickery and backstabbing,\" Khamenei is quoted as saying in a speech in Tehran. He suggested that the letter was part of a U.S. strategy of last-minute reversal aimed at undermining a comprehensive deal covering Iran's nuclear ambitions, Press TV said. \"This is part of their ploys and tricks,\" said Khamenei. Iran faces a March 24 deadline to reach a deal over its nuclear program. Several interim agreements have been made in recent months, though a long-term pact so far has been elusive. The six world powers -- the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, plus Germany, a group known as the P5+1 -- are seeking a deal that will ensure that Iran doesn't develop nuclear arms. Officials in Tehran have publicly insisted they want a nuclear program for energy purposes, not to create atomic weaponry. The Republican senators' decision to write to Iran's leaders has stirred up a political firestorm in the United States. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry denounced the letter Wednesday at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, calling it a breach of \"more than two centuries of precedent\" and factually incorrect. Did 47 Republican senators break the law in plain sight? \"It purports to tell the world that if you want to have any confidence in your dealings with America, they have to negotiate with 535 members of Congress,\" Kerry said. \"That is both untrue and a profoundly bad suggestion to make.\" Sen. Tom Cotton, a freshman Republican from Arkansas, penned the letter, which asserted that a lasting agreement would need congressional support. He wasn't shy about his attempts to undermine the Obama administration's negotiations with Iran and said Tuesday that the letter is \"about stopping Iran from getting a nuclear deal.\" Hillary Clinton blasts Cotton Iran letter .

Aisha Dannupawa, a housewife and mother-of-three, asked for her marriage to husband Ali Maizinari to be dissolved due to his large manhood. Their divorce was granted after just one week of marriage in a Islamic Sharia court in Nigeria's Zamfara State. Decision: The court in Zamfara State, Nigeria, granted the divorce. It was the first state in the country to introduce Sharia law . She told the court she had married Maizinari after her first marriage failed.

'I told my mother the experience but she told me to endure and that with time, I will be able to cope. She then gave me some drugs,' she said to Nigerian media. According to Dannupawa, the couple had sex again but it was 'too much to bear' and the couple concluded that no drug could help their sex life or their marriage. Maizinari did not deny the accusation and told the court he was willing to dissolve the union if his dowry and money spent during the courtship was paid back.

The Liverpool star was replaced at half-time by Steve Gerrard - who then returned to the changing rooms just 38 seconds later - and his injury-hit season looks to continue with his latest problem. Lallana is seen as a key player for England and his loss will be a major blow for Roy Hodgson ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania.

England will be looking to keep up their 100 percent record in their European Championships Qualifying group when they welcome Lithuania to Wembley on Friday, with Harry Kane in line to earn his first cap for his country.

On advice from doctors Alonso will have to wait for his competitive return with McLaren until the second race in Malaysia later this month. Although given a clean bill of health after sustaining concussion in a heavy crash in the second pre-season test in Barcelona on February 22, the fear of 'second-impact syndrome' has forced Alonso's hand.

Alonso tweeted his disappointment at not being able to make the season-opening F1 grand prix in Australia . The term refers to a second concussion occurring when the effects of the first are still subsiding, potentially resulting in severe brain injuries, or even death. Although the timespan between the accident and Alonso returning to the car for first practice in Melbourne on March 13 would appear to be sufficient, he is not prepared to take any risks. Via his Twitter account, Alonso said: 'It will be tough not to be in Australia, but I understand the recommendations. A second impact in less than 21 days 'NO' \u00a3countdownMalaysia.' For the Albert Park event Alonso's seat will now be occupied by Kevin Magnussen, demoted to reserve driver following the Spaniard's arrival after a full season with the team in 2014.

The 22-year-old Danish racer Kevin Magnussen will replace Alonso for McLaren at the Australian Grand Prix . To which a sporting Alonso replied: 'best of luck at the race mate! \u00a3BelieveInMcLarenHonda.' Explaining the circumstances behind the decision taken to withdraw Alonso from Australia, McLaren have revealed doctors found the 33-year-old to be 'asymptomatic', with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury' and 'entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives'. But given the prospect of second-impact syndrome Alonso was 'advised he should not compete in the imminent Australian Grand Prix meeting'. A McLaren statement added: 'Fernando has understood and accepted that advice. Fernando's doctors acknowledge he feels fit and well, and he regards himself as ready to race.

Daniel Icke, 21, and his 20-year-old brother Donovan had never driven before they stole a Ford Escort from outside a house in Wednesfield, West Midlands in December last year. They were stopped by PC Akwaal Baryana, who reached in to the car to take the keys when they pulled up at traffic lights and told them to get out. But Donovan, who was driving, ignored her warnings and put the car into reverse as PC Baryana clung on to the steering wheel. Theft: Donovan and Daniel Icke stole a car after breaking into a house and taking the vehicle's keys . The car careered backwards, crossed a busy dual carriage and crashed into a wall, causing the brave officer serious leg injuries. Donovan admitted assault causing actual bodily harm, aggravated vehicle taking and driving without a licence or insurance while his brother pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicle taking. But they were spared jail and given suspended prison sentences when they appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court yesterday. Donovan, was given a 12-month prison sentence suspended for two years and ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work. He was also banned from driving for 12 months and ordered to pay \u00a3500 compensation to PC Baryana. Ordeal: The brothers dragged a police officer 100ft down a road in Wednesfield, pictured . Daniel received a four-month suspended sentence, 120 hours of unpaid work and a 12-month driving ban, and will have to pay \u00a3250 compensation. Recorder Richard Benson QC said he had decided 'with some trepidation' not to send them to prison, adding: 'This was inexcusable and potentially lethal behaviour. 'Some will say I am failing in my duty but they would not have had the benefit of reading the reports I have seen and hearing the mitigation.' The court heard the brothers took the keys to the car from a home they had broken into at 4am on December 2. PC Baryana and a colleague responded to the break-in, then spotted the stolen car at a junction 10 minutes later. Target: The two men stole a Ford Focus similar to this one shown in a file photo . Prosecutor Emma Wynne-Owen said: 'She held on to the steering wheel which prevented her being dragged under the car as it travelled for a further 35 metres. 'She pleaded with him to stop but the car continued in reverse, crossing the dual carriageway, mounting the pavement and crashing into a wall. 'The officer then told Donovan Icke, \"I told you to stop,\" and he replied, \"sorry\".' Amanda Jenkins, defending the brothers, said: 'Neither had driven before and they argued over who should drive before Donovan stupidly took the wheel. 'They could not believe their luck. It was raining and they had a fair way to go to get home, so very foolishly they took the car. 'When the officer opened the driver's door Donovan panicked and put the vehicle into reverse. 'It swerved because the officer was holding the steering wheel. He did not know what to do but realises it could have been far more serious.'", "When it comes to relationships is honesty really the best policy?

Do you really need to know how many people the love of your life has had sex with? In a new video from Elite Daily  couples were asked: 'Do you guys know many people each other has slept with?' 'When I was in college, those numbers got stupid!' Some of the men weren't afraid to share . The reactions are brilliantly awkward as the couples admit that they have never asked the question, and then um and ah as they decide whether to reveal their magic numbers to each other. One woman nervously twists her hands as she admits: 'I think I've been a little more on the sexually adventurous side throughout my youth,' while another puts her fingers in her ears to stop from hearing her boyfriend's number. The guys are a little more impressed with their hook-up history with one saying: 'When I was in college those numbers got stupid. I played football. Those numbers got out of hand.' Another reveals, laughing: 'A little over the 150 number. I'm not afraid to admit anything about my past because it's brought me to where I am today.'

The Black Cats travel to Upton Park on Saturday evening just one point and one place outside of the Premier League relegation zone, having sacked Gus Poyet after last weekend's 4-0 home defeat to Aston Villa. Advocaat has been appointed until the end of the season with the aim of keeping the club in the top flight, and Cresswell - a Premier League ever-present for West Ham so far this campaign - knows the game takes on extra significance following the Dutchman's appointment. Aaron Cresswell (right) says West Ham are ready to face Sunderland on Saturday evening . Cresswell admits it will be tough facing a team who have just appointed a new manager . 'What was already set to be a tough but exciting game has that bit more to it now Sunderland have brought a new manager in,' he told West Ham's official website. 'I don't know too much about Dick Advocaat but he's certainly got a lot of experience and we're expecting a difficult match. Every game in the Premier League is a challenge and we will have to rise to it. 'When a new manager comes in it gives everyone at the club a lift and the players will want to impress the new manager. 'The first game under a new manager seems to favour the team with the new manager and I certainly think that was the case when we played West Bromwich Albion on New Year's Day just after Tony Pulis had taken over.' Dick Advocaat has taken over at Sunderland until the end of the season . Advocaat takes charge of the Black Cats for the first time away at West Ham on Saturday evening . Although Advocaat will want a positive result in his first game in charge, the fixture is also crucial to West Ham and their manager Sam Allardyce. Following an impressive start, Allardyce has seen his side fall away from the pack chasing European qualification with the Hammers having won just one of their last 12 league games. In that spell they have come up against Liverpool, Manchester United, Southampton, Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea but, of their final nine league outings, only two come against sides in the top half. 'We've had a tough run of fixtures recently and while no game is easy in the Premier League, some are harder than others,' Cresswell added. 'Having played all the top clubs in the last two months, we know that we have a fair few winnable games in our last nine games so I firmly believe we can finish strongly. 'We haven't had the results that we feel our performances deserve so we need to work that bit harder to make sure we get what our performances merit. No one at the club wants the season to fade away and we want to finish as high as we can.'", "A celebrated sea otter who survived a natural oil slick and was tracked by researchers for six years has been killed by a shark.

Marcus Johnson Jr visited O'Fallon Park with his parents, four siblings, and other friends and family members while recovering from heart surgery one week earlier. He had a post-operation appointment the day he was killed. Police are searching for the occupants of a car who shot at the family's minivan as they left the north St Louis park in a minivan at about 7.30pm on March 11. Marcus Johnson Jr.'s parents figured a day at a city park was just what the 6-year-old kindergartner needed while recovering from heart surgery the previous week. Instead, his family buried Marcus today after the child was shot in the chest and killed in an attack his mother and father said stemmed from a traffic dispute . Marcus Johnson Sr. said he returned fire in self-defense as the rolling shootout continued for several blocks. Marcus's 15-year-old brother and a 69-year-old family friend were also wounded. 'My baby already had stress to live in this world, and for somebody to take his life away is wrong,' mother Quiana Johnson told the St Louis Post Dispatch. She said that Marcus, who was in kindergarten, had suffered from a heart ailment since birth. His family had to watch him closely because he was taking blood-thinning drugs so he had to be careful not to get bruised. 'He was a happy, happy, loving and caring kid,' she told the St Louis Post Dispatch. 'Through his sickness he was happy.' The day of the shooting, the family had piled into their recently purchased 2006 Pontiac Montana and headed to the park. Quiana Johnson said it 'was a nice day' and that it gave them a chance to 'get out of the house and do some things as a family'. She said that as they were leaving, her husband saw someone he knew and stopped his vehicle to chat, annoying another man who was stuck because of the traffic. Quiana Johnson said the man told them it was his 'hood' and that the family shouldn't hold up traffic. Marcus suffered from a heart ailment and had surgery the week before he was shot. He had been at a post-operation appointment prior to going to the park. His mother said he was taking blood-thinning drugs and had to be careful not to get bruised . The family returned to the car and as they drove to the exit of the park, the man followed them and began shooting. Quiana Johnson had a gun on her - which she had recently bought because of a fear of break-ins in her neighborhood - and when she noticed her son had been shot, she handed it to her husband. 'I told him that if he didn't shoot back, they will kill us all,' she told the St Louis Post Dispatch. She crawled to the back of the van, where her son had been shot and the rest of her family members were huddling. 'I said, \"little Marcus, wake up. Don't go to sleep. Mommy is right here with you. Wake up.\" He was trying,' she said. Once they escaped the shooting they called the police who took Marcus to Barnes-Jewish Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Funeral arrangements were taken care of at Ronald L Jones Funeral Chapel in St Louis. Johnson said Marcus, his youngest son, was diagnosed with a heart ailment as an infant.", "Atlanta (CNN)Former CIA director and retired Gen. David Petraeus remains a trusted adviser to the White House on its strategy in Iraq, despite being convicted of leaking classified information to his mistress and biographer, then lying to the FBI. The National Security Council and Obama administration have been consulting with Petraeus on matters related to Iraq and ISIS, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed on Monday. Earnest did not elaborate how long Petraeus has been advising the White House since his fall from grace, but Newsweek reports the retired four-star general has been in the role since last summer. \"Gen. Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq. He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country,\" Earnest said. \"He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert, when it comes to the security situation in Iraq. So I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to, on occasion, consult for him advice.\" Once considered a possible presidential candidate, Petraeus plead guilty to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information earlier this month as part of a plea deal approved by Attorney General Eric Holder. According to court documents, Petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer, Paula Broadwell. After he resigned from his CIA post in 2012, Petraeus told the government he had no classified materials in his possession. That claim turned out to be false as the FBI found the notebooks when they conducted a search of Petraeus' house in 2013. When he was questioned by the FBI at the time, he lied and claimed he never provided classified information to anyone not authorized to have it, according to court documents. Earnest says he is unaware of any particular security precautions put in place by the White House when it consults with Petraeus, despite his legal problems and lack of CIA security clearance. Petraeus is currently the chairman of a global institute for private equity firm KKR.", "(CNN)Cleveland's mayor apologized Monday for the city's \"poor use of words and our insensitivity\" in the Tamir Rice case. Mayor Frank Jackson told reporters the city was apologizing to the Rice family and the people of Cleveland for the wording of a legal filing last week, which said the death of Tamir, a 12-year-old who was shot by police in November, was the sixth-grader's own fault. \"We did something that ... is hurtful to the family, that is disrespectful to them and the victim as well as the city of Cleveland,\" he said. The wording in the legal filing, Jackson said, was standard language used in legal defense, and the insensitivity \"was not intended.\" But now, he said, the city will be rewording its filing -- a decision he pushed for as soon as he found out about it. \"What I care about right now is that the family of Tamir Rice and the people of the city of Cleveland understand and realize that we are sorry for what we have done and that we apologize to them,\" Jackson said. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Rice family, said the mayor's apology didn't go far enough. \"I don't want him just to apologize for the poor word use and the grammatical phrases,\" Crump told CNN's \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\" on Monday. \"I want him to apologize for the death of this 12-year-old child, one of his citizens, at the hands of what we believe were police officers who were improperly trained.\" Cleveland Police Officer Timothy Loehmann fired the fatal shots at Tamir in November within two seconds of arriving outside a recreation center where the 12-year-old was playing with a pellet gun. \"They never even gave him a chance,\" Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\" The whole world has seen the same video like I've seen, and I'm sure the whole world is saying, 'You guys never gave him a chance.' With that being said, it can never be justified.\" Cleveland authorities have repeatedly said that Loehmann mistook Tamir's fake gun for a real one. Cuyahoga County's medical examiner has ruled the death a homicide but has issued no determination as to whether the events that caused the boy's death constitute a crime. In its 41-page response to the family's lawsuit filed Friday, the city says that Tamir's injuries \"were directly and proximately caused by the failure of Plaintiffs' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury.\" The response further says that \"Plaintiffs' decedent's injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by the acts of Plaintiffs' decedent, not this Defendant.\" Another attorney for the Rice family has said the city's response to the lawsuit last week was indicative of well-documented problems within the Cleveland Police Department. \"The Rice family maintains that Tamir was shot and killed unnecessarily by Cleveland police officers,\" Rice family co-counsel Walter Madison said in a statement.  \"Their tactics that preceded his death and the subsequent victim blaming are examples of the institutionalized behavior that has beset the Cleveland Police Department. The Rice family's lawsuit seeks to eliminate certain institutional behaviors and practices that have no place in our diverse community.\" CNN's Eliott C.

Each count carries a possible sentence of 10 years to life in Nevada state prison. Sharper, 39, is sought on a warrant in Las Vegas, but he has been jailed since Feb. 27 in Los Angeles, where he was due for a preliminary hearing Friday after pleading not guilty to drugging and raping two women in 2013. He faces rape allegations in New Orleans, where he's accused of sexually assaulting three women in 2013. He has also been indicted in Arizona on charges he drugged three women and sexually assaulted two of them in November 2013 in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. Sharper is also under investigation in Florida for sexual assault. Exact details of the Las Vegas case have not yet been made public, but they are likely similar to the other three cases in which after a night out he would allegedly take a woman or women home who later reported they believed he served them a drink mixed with an illicit substance.

After being cautioned for simulation, the former Real Madrid midfielder remonstrated with referee Oliver and then grabbed the back of his shirt and yelled at the official when he had turned his back on him. Replays showed the first booking on Di Maria was harsh and Aaron Ramsey had pulled the player back, but the \u00a360million man's actions thereafter deserved sanction, according to Van Gaal.

The result kept them third in the Primeira Liga and on course for Champions League qualification, though their chances of bridging the 12-point gap to leaders Benfica are slim. Nani celebrates his headed winning goal as Sporting Lisbon beat Penafiel 3-2 on Monday night . They were made to work hard by bottom-of-the-table Penafiel, who fought back from two goals down to draw level after Sporting centre-half Tobias Figueiredo was sent off. Having come into the match off the back of a 3-0 loss to Porto, Sporting needed a positive start and goals from William and Islam Slimani had them two the good inside eight minutes. But Figueiredo's red card gave the visitors hope and they replied through veteran midfielder Bruno Braga in the 12th minute. The Manchester United loanee celebrated his 70th-minute winner with a trademark flip . And they levelled three minutes shy of half-time through Vitor Bruno. However, Sporting were still too strong and Nani's winner - a firm header from 12 yards following a right-wing cross - proved decisive.

The suit filed by former captain Clayton Osbon three years after his meltdown on a flight from New York to Las Vegas, comes amid increased scrutiny of how major airlines evaluate pilots' mental health in the wake of the allegedly intentional crash of a Germanwings . Osbon, 52, claims in the lawsuit that officials at JetBlue missed several indications that something was wrong with his mental health the day of the flight, noting he missed a pre-flight meeting for the first time in years and arrived to fly disheveled and disoriented. Scroll down for video . Restrained: Clayton Osbon, 52, pictured here being taken off a New York to Las Vegas flight after his breakdown, is suing JetBlue for failing to recognize he was mentally ill . Osbon moved slowly during pre-flight checks for the flight to Las Vegas from New York, and later relieved himself of duty after being told by the first officer he had missed several calls from air traffic control, the lawsuit adds. After a co-pilot locked Osbon out of the cockpit, he 'ran down the aisles screaming and ranting concerning imagined terrorism and the need for all on board on embrace religion.' The lawsuit alleges that JetBlue allowed the flight to continue for three hours and 'unnecessarily endangered the lives of Captain Osbon, the crew and the 135 passengers.' There were no injuries on the flight, which eventually made an emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas. The meltdown resulted from a complex partial brain seizure that 'severely impaired his ability to perform basic activities, caused him to hallucinate, and caused extreme feelings of paranoia and religious fervor,' according to the suit. The lawsuit also alleges the airline routinely ignored crew members' impairment, whether by alcohol, drugs or mental and emotional distress, in order to protect their careers. Hospitalized: Osbon, right, is led out by FBI agents after being released from Northwest Texas hospital in Amarillo following his mid-air breakdown . Veteran captain: Osbon, left, was an experienced pilot but a 'complex partial brain seizure' impaired his brain functions and caused him to hallucinate, according to the lawsuit . Nearly three dozen passengers sued JetBlue in 2012 for being 'grossly negligent' by allowing Osbon to fly with unchecked mental issues. JetBlue eventually settled the lawsuit in April of the following year for an undisclosed sum. After the flight was grounded in Texas, Osbon was indicted on charges of interfering with a flight crew and found not guilty by reason of insanity. Among other conditions of his sentence, Osbon was ordered not to board a commercial or private plane without permission from a probation officer. Osbon remains suspended on medical leave, no longer collecting what once was a more than $300,000 annual salary. The lawsuit states he has not suffered a seizure since beginning a regimen of prescription medication.", "The International Association of Athletics Federations has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over the punishments handed out to six Russian drug cheats. Athletics' world governing body said it disagreed with the 'selective disqualification of results' applied by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).

The 20-year-old is currently locked in contract negotiations with the Reds after rejecting what manager Brendan Rodgers described as an 'incredible' offer, reportedly \u00a3100,000-a-week. His current deal is not due to expire until 2017 but the current impasse in talks - which will not resume until the end of the season - has led the youngster to be linked with a number of Europe's top clubs. There has been much speculation over the future of Liverpool youngster Raheem Sterling (centre) Sterling, who is currently on international duty with England, is in the process of negotiating a new contract . Barnes believes it would be a mistake, however, for Sterling to go looking for a multi-million pound move before he has properly proved himself. 'I would advise any young player who has been in the game for one or one and half years to stay and learn his trade,' he told talkSPORT. 'Show consistency over a four or five-year period before you make a big move, because then he will be judged as a \u00a350million player. 'I don't think he is ready for a move to Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester City. Talks have finished until the end of the season, but there has been speculation over a big-money move abroad . Former Liverpool winger John Barnes believes that Sterling should stay and learn his trade at Anfield . 'As a Liverpool fan I want him to stay but I think himself he needs to be very careful. 'Unfortunately the bad advice often sounds the most lucrative and therefore the best advice. 'Has he been playing consistently well over a long time? No he hasn't, and maybe his form has suffered because of the whole situation about that (contract).' Barnes said recent history is littered with examples of poor decisions and failures by young players and he did not want Sterling to make the same mistake. 'We saw it with Scott Sinclair and Jack Rodwell, who both went to Man City. Where are they now?' he added. 'I think any young player should show a level of consistency where you are happy and people accept you and then if you want to put yourself under pressure by making a big money move do that - because it can all go wrong. Sterling needs to show consistency over a four or five-year period to warrant a big move, according to Barnes . Barnes noted that Sterling should not make the same mistake as Scott Sinclair, who moved prematurely . 'I think [he needs] another two or three years at Liverpool and if he then decides he wants to move on then fine.' While Sterling is still trying to establish himself as one of Liverpool's top players, one of their very best - Steven Gerrard - will be leaving in the summer to join Los Angeles Galaxy. There have been suggestions the Reds captain's legacy has been tarnished somewhat by his senseless sending-off against Manchester United last Sunday, coming a year after his slip against Chelsea played a huge part in the club missing out on the title. Barnes, however, dismissed such talk. 'Steven Gerrard and Kenny Dalglish are the two greatest players for Liverpool,' he said. 'Nothing has changed because he got sent off against Manchester United and nothing will change in the rest for the season.'", "Jamie Carragher has hailed the impact of Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who put a first-half error behind him to help the Blues to victory against Hull City. Chelsea went 2-0 up through Eden Hazard and Diego Costa, but Hull pulled level after Courtois gifted possession to Abel Hernandez just before the half-hour mark. And Carragher, speaking on Sky Sports after the game, thinks that despite his error, there are few goalkeepers as good as the Chelsea man. Thibaut Courtois made an error in the first half to gift Hull their equalising goal against Chelsea . Courtois gave away possession under pressure from Gaston Ramirez to allow Abel Hernandez to score . 'He had a bit of a mix-up in the first half,' the Sportsmail pundit said. 'He's a world class goalkeeper to keep Petr Cech out and what he did last year for Atletico Madrid, getting to the Champions League final. 'He's a fantastic keeper and he's going to be one of the world's best for a decade or so.' Speaking alongside Carragher was former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, who was in agreement at Courtois' excellent game despite the high-profile error. 'Before the mistake, he made a couple of saves that kept Chelsea in the game,' Henry noted. 'But it's not about the mistake, it's about how you respond, and he responded well in the second half.' Chelsea's 3-2 win took them back to winning ways after a draw against Southampton last time out, and restored their six-point gap ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. Jamie Carragher (left) and Thierry Henry hailed Courtois' impact in the second half to save Chelsea . Courtois made a string of saves, including three in quick succession, to help Jose Mourinho's side to victory . Their win at Hull was far from convincing, but according to Henry, getting three points in the manner Chelsea did is a mark of their winning mentality. 'Big teams will do that to you,' he said. 'Three attempts on target, three goals. It sounds simple, but that's what Chelsea are about. 'Hull were unlucky in the second half on a couple of occasions, but that's what a big team does to you. They come here, they don't really perform well, they find themselves in a difficult situation, and they managed.' One negative for Mourinho will be the injury to Diego Costa, which forced him off with 15 minutes to play holding his hamstring. Carragher thinks Courtois (pictured) will be one of the world's best goalkeepers for a decade . Carragher and Henry also believe that Chelsea's title hopes will remain successful, even without Diego Costa . Chelsea's strike force is such that Costa's absence is unlikely to be a devastating blow, and the presence of Remy in the latter stages actually forced a winner for the league leaders. 'It looks like a hamstring injury and we know his history from the Champions League final,' Carragher said of Costa. 'If it is a hamstring injury, if Remy has to come in, he's come on there [against Hull] and he's made a difference. 'He scored in the Manchester City game as well. He's not what you'd call top level, he hasn't played that much, we know Jose just likes to play the same players. He's not at Costa's level, but he's enough to go up front and take them to the title. 'They've got that gap now, if they miss him for two or three games - depending on how bad the injury is - I think they'll be fine.'", "A group of fishermen in Townsville, Queensland, got a nasty surprise when a crocodile surfaced and stole their catch off the end of the line.

He said: 'College kids now are so politically correct. I mean, to the point where \u2014 I'll give you an example, we had interns at the show, college interns. 'Like, the last year of the show, one of the interns comes and says, \"Mr. Leno, I'm getting lunch. what do you want?' I said, 'I don't know, where are you going?' 'He said, \"we're getting Mexican.\" I said, \"I don't really like Mexican.\" He goes, \"whoa, that's kind of racist\".' Leno then shouts: 'That's not racist.' 'No, being anti-guacamole is not racist, okay? You have no idea what racism is. That's not racist, you idiot, you moron.' Carrying on the theme, Leno talked about how his grandfather. 'He only ate Italian food. It was always amazing to him that he would eat out of their ethnic groups,' the comedian said. 'Like he would say, \"Oh my God! A Chinese guy with a hot dog, look at that!'' They started talking about college when Meyers started talking about Leno's string of stand-up appearances.

But this series of heartwarming pictures by photographer Souvik Kundu shows a tiger sparing the deer's life and, instead of making it an easy snack, deciding to play with it and treat it like one of its own. The moment occurred at the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in India with the confused tiger snapped jumping next to the tiny deer, nuzzling with it, and even carrying it gently in its mouth like a cub. Photographer Souvik Kundu snapped pictures of a tiger playing with a fawn at the\u00a0Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in India . Crowds at the Maharashtra reserve gasped as they predicted the spotted deer fawn would face a swift and gruesome death at the paws of the giant feline. Instead, the unlikely two appear to become the best of friends, with the gentle tigress tenderly playing with it, before leaving the deer unharmed to live another day. Photographer Souvik said: 'When she slowly emerged from cover we were astonished to find she was playing with a hapless spotted deer fawn. 'The tigress seemed to be in a playful mood, jumping around in excitement.' The adorable encounter lasted for about 15 minutes, before the big cat retreated and allowed the small deer to rest in the grass. Photographer Souvik Kundu, 35, from Mumbai witnessed the tigress nuzzling the spotted deer fawn like one of her cubs . The joyful cat was seen jumping next to the deer, patting it and even carrying it in her mouth like a cub . The expectation among the crowd was that the feline would swiftly kill the deer and devour it . Souvik, 35, from Mumbai entitled photographs of the event, The Benevolent Queen, due to the tiger's gentle nature. He added: 'I'm still not sure why the tigress did not prey on the little deer when the chance presented and acted so unnaturally. 'One probable explanation is the tigress was in search for a mate and her urge for motherhood temporarily overcame predatory instinct. Play with me! The tigress instead just wants to play with the baby deer and kept patting it with its paws . Souvik said it was possible the tigress confused the fawn with her own offspring . 'As a result she had confused the fawn for her own offspring.' The Tadoba Andhari Reserve is the largest national park in Maharashtra, covering a total area of 241 square miles. The area was home to\u00a043 tigers when a census was conducted in 2010. The photographs form a series entitled, The Benevolent Queen, due to the tiger's gentle nature .

The Prime Minister sparked outrage when he backed a West Australian plan to close 150 remote communities on Tuesday, saying governments couldn't endlessly subsidise people who chose to live far away from schools and jobs. 'It is not the job of the taxpayer to subsidise lifestyle choices,' Mr Abbott told ABC Radio in Kalgoorlie on Tuesday. Tony Abbott is refusing to apologise for controversially saying taxpayers shouldn't fund the 'lifestyle choices' of Australians in remote communities despite backlash from indigenous leaders . 'Fine, by all means live in a remote location, but there's a limit to what you can expect the state to do for you if you want to live there. 'What we can't do is endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices if those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in Australian society that everyone should have.' Labor and the Greens are demanding he apologise for comments they have described as racist and highly offensive. Speaking on Sydney's 2GB Radio on Wednesday, Mr Abbott defended his comments saying he was just being realistic and stating a 'general principle'. 'If you or I chose to live in a very remote place, to what extent is the taxpayer obliged to subsidise our services?' he told host Alan Jones. Mr Abbott's chief indigenous adviser, Warren Mundine (left), disagreed with the PM saying: 'It is not like retiring and moving for a sea change, it is about thousands of years connection' Speaking on Sydney's 2GB Radio on Wednesday, Mr Abbott defended his comments saying he was just being realistic and stating a 'general principle' 'It is incredibly difficult for the kids to go to school if there's only half a dozen of them and getting teachers there is all but impossible. 'Similarly, it's very difficult for the adults to get a proper job if there's no employment within hundreds of miles and this is where we have to be a little bit realistic.' But the prime minister's chief indigenous adviser, Warren Mundine, disagreed with his comments. 'That is a complete misconception of what it is and he's wrong in that regard,' Mr Mundine told Fairfax Media. 'It is not about a lifestyle, it is not like retiring and moving for a sea change, it is about thousands of years connection, their religious beliefs and the essence of who they are.' Mr Abbott said there was a limit to what people living in remote communities could expect from the government if they chose to live there . Mr Mundine said the prime minister's comments were a misconception . The hashtag #lifestylechoices started trending on Twitter on Wednesday following the PM's comments. Opposition indigenous affairs spokesman Shayne Neumann demanded a public apology to all Australians for what he called 'deeply disturbing and highly offensive' comments . 'This is a prime minister who doesn't understand the importance of these people to their connectivity to their land,' he told AAP. The hashtag #lifestylechoices started trending on Twitter on Wednesday following the PM's comments . Mr Neumann accused Mr Abbott of trying to undo any progress made in closing the gap of indigenous disadvantage. Mr Abbott said it was reasonable for state governments to stop funding services in remote communities if the costs were out of proportion to the benefits. Greens senator Rachel Siewert slammed the comments as 'unbelievably racist' and completely out of touch with reality.", "Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has called on Renault to get their act together and help save his organisation's season. Horner was left fuming following the opening race in Australia on Sunday after Red Bull found themselves severely handicapped by power-unit supplier Renault over the course of the weekend. Initially, the Milton Keynes-based marque were forced to change the power unit on Daniel Ricciardo's car in between practice sessions on Friday due to a problem with the engine. Red Bull chief Christian Horner has accused engine supplier Renault of going backwards this season . Daniel Ricciardo could only manage a sixth-placed finish for Red Bull during the Australian Grand Prix . Red Bull's second driver\u00a0Daniil Kvyat pulled out of Sunday's opening race with a gear box failure . Come the race further embarrassment followed as Daniil Kvyat, on his debut for the team following his promotion last year from Toro Rosso, retired on the formation lap with a suspected gearbox failure. Horner has already called on the FIA to introduce equalisation rules as he fears Mercedes will continue to dominate after their easy one-two around Melbourne's Albert Park, spearheaded by Lewis Hamilton. More pertinently, though, Horner knows Renault have to up their game otherwise the rest of the campaign will be a washout. 'Renault need to have a clear vision and they need it quickly,' said Horner. 'You can see Ferrari have made a good step forward, whereas Renault at this stage appear to have made a retrograde step. 'It's frustrating we are effectively further back than we were in Abu Dhabi in both power and driveability. 'It means we haven't seen the potential of our car yet because it's masked by the engine issues we have.' Max Verstappen (centre) walks back to Toro Rosso team garage after retiring from the Australian Grand Prix . Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg finished first and second respectively at the Australian Grand Prix . VIDEO Hamilton cruises to victory in Australian GP . As to the steps required over the coming weeks, Horner added: 'First we have to understand what the problem is in order to address it. 'Until Renault get to the bottom of what the issues are they are very difficult to address. A lot of dyno running needs to be done in order to understand. 'It's important we regroup with Renault and offer support where we can because it's obviously in a bit of a mess at the moment. 'But we need to understand things quickly. Across the four cars (Renault also supply Toro Rosso) we had two engine failures - one within five laps - and a whole bunch of reliability problems. 'It's not the start Renault can afford to have.' After an abysmal start to pre-season a year ago Red Bull recovered to claim three wins and finish second in the constructors' championship, albeit a long way adrift of Mercedes. Red Bull struggled to keep up with Mercedes, WIlliams and Ferrari at the Australian Grand Prix . Red Bull and Renault were expected to take a step closer this season, but instead Horner fears they will be cut adrift. Asked whether Renault were capable of producing a championship- challenging engine, Horner replied: 'This year, no. 'But we need to be doing a lot better than we are. We need to be challenging Ferrari and Williams. 'If we sort the issues out then we can do that, but the drivers need to have a fair run at it and they didn't have that over the weekend.'", "The Ministry of Defence was last year forced to pay out more than \u00a31million a month in compensation claims for bureaucrats injured at work, new figures reveal. In the last year alone the MoD paid out \u00a313.5million in compensation to civilian staff \u2013 which amounts to almost a third of the \u00a345million given to serving soldiers. It means that for every \u00a33,000 paid  to injured soldiers the government handed \u00a31,000 to MoD bureaucrats for office falls, according to the figures released under freedom of information rules. While soldiers in Afghanistan have risked their lives fighting the Taliban, MoD staff stationed in the UK are constantly being carted off to hospital for trips, falls, crashes and bizarre health and safety incidents. Soldiers, pictured attending the annual Irish Guards St Patrick's Day Parade in Aldershot this week, have received \u00a345million in compensation last year - but another \u00a313.5million was paid to bureaucrats . The details of the catalogue of mishaps to befall military personnel in the UK were revealed by safety officers who have had to record all serious incidents for the Health and Safety Executive. Although there were parachuting, roping and other training course injuries sustained by military personnel last year there were also a host of more mundane office based accidents. In one, a man rushed back into his office to answer the phone on his desk only to trip over a hidden vacuum cleaner. The person smashed into a rubbish bin and their office chair and needed a week off work to recover from the injuries. Another person was walking out of a meeting when they were distracted by a colleague and ended up walking into a wall and breaking their wrist. One person hurt their back when the legs on the right side of their chair snapped off sending the person toppling onto the floor. In a similar incident a roller came off one of the legs of a moveable office chair sending the person who was sitting in it crashing to the floor. A member of the public who was visiting a recreation of a World War I trench ended up in hospital with a gash to their head when they stood on a crate to get a view over the top and toppled back over. In a separate case a group of cadets were injured when the camping gas canister they were using to cook a meal exploded, leaving one girl with bad burns. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was last year forced to pay out more than \u00a31million a month in compensation claims for bureaucrats injured at work, new figures reveal . Another MOD worker was off work for more than a month after they injured their bladder in a slip on the newly cleaned floor of the office toilets, while a dog handler suffered bad cuts after trying to separate a fight between two military dogs. All the incidents were recorded on RIDDOR forms which the Health and Safety Executive make organisations fill out when there has been a serious injury in the workplace or a dangerous incident that could have led to an accident. An MOD spokesperson said: 'MOD has a duty of care to all its employees whether military or civilian personnel. 'Claims brought for civil damages are considered on the basis of complex legal liability and where liability is proved compensation is paid but we robustly resist spurious claims. 'The amount of compensation is determined by common law principles and payments are often made to those who have suffered the most severe injuries in the course of their work.'", "It has been described as an architecturally designed modernist property that was built ahead of its time.

The 25-year-old American scored one goal in 42 Premier League appearances in the red and white of Sunderland, while before that he netted just once in a season-long loan spell at Hull City. His time in England concluded with two goals in 70 Premier League matches - against Manchester City and Chelsea, to be fair - but upon returning to the league in which he began his career, Altidore scored twice to help Toronto to a 3-1 victory in their first game of the season.

Altidore celebrates his one and only Premier League goal for Sunderland, against Chelsea in December 2013 . In the latter stages of the game, the former Sunderland man was brought down in the box by Pa Modou Kah, and opted to take the spot-kick himself.

Ever since the superstar songstress released her surprise self-titled album in December 2013, it seems like dropping music with little to no fanfare has become a thing. The latest artist to do so is rapper Kendrick Lamar, whose eagerly awaited sophomore album was set for release March 23. Instead, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" was made available on iTunes and Spotify early Monday. Lamar, who has been hailed as the savior of hip-hop, got a major shout-out from fellow artist Taylor Swift. Among the other artists who've surprised fans: . Drake . The rapper thrilled fans in February when he snuck out \"If You're Reading This, It's Too Late.\" Like Beyonce, he clued fans in via an Instagram post. The 17-track project was billed as a mixtape. The rapper also released a short film titled \"Jungle.\" U2 . The shock in the band's album \"Songs of Innocence\" was not only that it was released but that iTunes subscribers had no choice but to get it. Apple made the album part of an automatic download in October as part of the iPhone 6 announcement. U2 frontman Bono later apologized, and Apple distributed info to customers on how they could delete the album after some complained that the automatic download was invasive. David Bowie . In 2013, the legendary rocker unexpectedly released \"The Next Day.\" It was his first new project in a decade, and fans were thrilled, as the famously private Bowie had been off the grid for a while. Wolfmother . The Australian trio received much less attention than some others when they dropped \"New Crown\" in March 2014 with no promotion or marketing. Kid Cudi . The rapper's \"Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon\" arrived online in March 2014 and led Billboard to ask, \"Is the Beyonce approach working for other 'surprise' albums?\" \"I wonder when this is done frequently, does the surprise factor wane?\" one executive told Billboard. \"If there are a lot of releases promoted this way, it will become less impactful. If mid-level and lower-level artists pile in, will the surprise get applied to the point where the public doesn't care anymore?\"", "Match of the Day commentator Jonathan Pearce got more than he bargained for at the Emirates on Sunday afternoon, when a rogue sprinkler soaked him ahead of kick-off. The 55-year-old BBC stalwart was preparing to present a piece to camera ahead of Arsenal's match with Everton, but got caught short when a sprinkler was turned on just seconds before he went on air. 'You could have told us', Pearce can be heard saying after he jumped out of shot - and out of reach of the water - but he appeared to take it in good spirits when he explained the reason for his soaking on air minutes later.

So yeah, very funny, this Sunday lunchtime.' Pearce was at the Emirates to see Arsenal attempt to take three points against Everton, a result which would see them go third in the Premier League table, ahead of Manchester United.

Based on the personal information provided by over 10,000 people in the 2012 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, the report states that lesbians earn 33 per cent more than heterosexual women. However the reason for the extra pay is due to the survey sample noting that they work about 20 per cent more hours, the University of Melbourne's Mark Wooden said. Based on the personal information provided by over 10,000 people in the 2012 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, the report states that lesbians earn 33 per cent more than heterosexual women . 'One explanation for the increased earnings and longer work hours of lesbians might be that this group are less likely to have children than heterosexual women,' he said. The HILDA Survey recorded that only 22 per cent of lesbian women between the ages of 30 and 49 had children three years ago, compared to almost 60 per cent of straight women. Gay men on the other hand, were found to earn about 20 per cent less than heterosexual men due to a lower rate of earnings' growth. The gap in pay only worsened for those who lived with a partner, despite lesbians living with their significant other recording higher wages than those without. 'We found that the wages of gay men are growing at a much slower rate than the wages of heterosexual males,' Prof Wooden said. University of Melbourne's (pictured) Mark Wooden said gay men  were found to earn about 20 per cent less than heterosexual men due to a lower rate of earnings' growth . 'Gay males who are most likely to be observably gay by employers\u2014those who live with a same-sex partner\u2014face larger earnings penalties than those who are discreet about their sexuality.' The report added that 'gay men are 16 per cent less likely to be employed and are substantially more likely to have several periods of joblessness than heterosexual men'. Although admitting that numerous factors contribute to the varying earnings across sexual orientation, Professor Wooden admitted that 'employer discrimination is likely a major part of the explanation for these wage gaps, especially in the case of gay men'. The findings are outlined in the Sexual Identity, Earnings, and Labour Market Dynamics: New Evidence from Longitudinal Data in Australia report.", "The treatment of Gareth Bale in Spain suggests it is not just in the Premier League that foreign players can get a raw deal.

The police watchdog is to examine claims that a paedophile sergeant ordered a junior officer not to tell anyone after catching Cyril Smith at a sex party with two boys. The account of the officer, then a young beat bobby but now retired, that he was threatened with the Official Secrets Act after he found the 29-stone Liberal MP at the home of a known sex offender in 1988 was the latest piece of evidence of an Establishment cover-up of Smith\u2019s decades of abuse. Yesterday the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC) announced it would be overseeing the investigation into the unnamed ex-officer\u2019s claims. He came forward earlier this month to describe how as a probationary officer he discovered Smith at the party with a prolific sex offender and two drunk teenage boys in Stockport. Smith and another officer in civilian clothes who was also present walked off, he said, while one boy left and the other was taken back to his children\u2019s home. He claimed that the following day he was called to a meeting by a senior officer and Sergeant Don Mackintosh and told he would be breaching the Official Secrets Act if he ever told anyone. \u2018In no uncertain terms I was told to say nothing,\u2019 he said. \u2018They knew Smith was there and knew who he was.\u2019 Mackintosh was later exposed as a prolific abuser of young boys over more than a decade. He was found hanged in his home last year while facing fresh indecent assault allegations. The retired officer claimed that earlier this year he had an anonymous call from a man who warned him to \u2018keep your mouth shut\u2019. The allegation about Smith is already being investigated by Greater Manchester Police\u2019s Operation Clifton which is looking at how previous reports of child sexual abuse were handled or allegedly covered up. But yesterday the IPCC said it would now \u2018manage\u2019 how the alleged incident in 1988 was investigated. \u2018The IPCC\u2019s involvement will ensure independent oversight of the investigation, while ensuring Greater Manchester Police\u2019s wider ongoing criminal investigation is not affected,\u2019 a spokesman said. Serial child abuser Smith, who was MP for Rochdale from 1972 to 1992 and died aged 82 in 2010, escaped possible prosecution at least eight times after orders were made at the highest level to cover up his crimes. The officer was pulled in by Sergeant Don Mackintosh, who turned out to be paedophile, left, who threatened him with the Official Secrets Act and told him to stay silent about his claims over Smith (right) Last year the Daily Mail exposed his pervert past when it serialised Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk\u2019s book, Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith. It revealed Smith avoided police and court action for decades despite leaving a trail of victims. Most recently, the Mail revealed how a former chief constable of Lancashire was told in the late 1970s that an official at the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions had asked his force to lie about past investigations into Smith. Mr Danczuk said: \u2018I welcome the fact that the IPCC are investigating the possibility of a police paedophile cover-up. This incident suggests there could have been a paedophile network straddling both politics and the police.\u2019 Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.", "There were just 22 cases of meningitis W in 2009, but this shot up to 117 last year, according to Public Health England (file image) A major immunisation programme aims to protect teenagers against a potentially lethal new strain of meningitis after a steep rise in cases. There were just 22 cases of meningitis W in 2009, but this shot up to 117 last year, according to Public Health England. This is a rise of 431 per cent. Some experts said the levels could even indicate a public health emergency. While the rise was initially seen in adults, it has now extended to all age groups and, for the first time in a decade, young children have died as a result of MenW. There has also been a rise in cases among students. It is proposed to immunise teenagers aged 14 to 18 in an attempt to halt the disease\u2019s spread. Andrew Pollard, chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said the upsurge in cases was caused by a \u2018highly aggressive strain of the bug\u2019. He said: \u2018We reviewed the outbreak in detail and concluded that this increase was likely to continue in future years unless action is taken. \u2018We have therefore advised the Department of Health to implement a vaccination programme for teenagers as soon as possible which we believe will have a substantial impact on the disease and protect the public\u2019s health.\u2019 Campaigners said the Government\u2019s delay in introducing a vaccine against meningitis B \u2013 the last major strain of the disease \u2013 may have hindered the fight. Statistics show one baby dies every month in Britain from meningitis B and charities claim dozens of lives have needlessly been lost to the disease because of procrastination by officials. Chris Head, of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: \u2018We applaud the quick action by the Government to protect 14 to 18-year-olds using the MenACWY vaccine. \u2018However, it will take more than a year for this protection to filter through to toddlers and infants, and in the meantime under-fives will still be dying and disabled as a result of MenW.\u2019", "UEFA president Michel Platini has defended a ban on third party ownership (TPO) of footballers - labelling the practice 'shameful' and a form of 'slavery'. Super agent Jorge Mendes, who includes Cristiano Ronaldo and Jose Mourinho among his clients, has claimed the ban is illegal and will kill competition in Europe. The Spanish and Portuguese leagues have also opposed the ban. TPO is a practice which takes place in several countries, particularly in South America, where companies own the economic rights of players and benefit from their transfer fees. It has been banned in the Premier League since 2008. UEFA president Michel Platini has defended a ban on third party ownership (TPO) of footballers . Platini, who pushed FIFA to impose the ban - said the ban would stop huge sums of money disappearing from football. Speaking on a UEFA video forum in response to a question from Paris St Germain manager Laurent Blanc, Platini said: 'I have put a lot of pressure on FIFA to stop third party ownership. 'Today, it's shameful to see some players with one of their arms belonging to one person, a leg belonging to a funds pension located who knows where, and a third person owning his foot. 'It is shameful; we're dealing with a type of slavery that belongs to the past. 'Everyone earns money on such transfers, and while we are trying to find money to invest in football, that money goes in the pockets of I don't know who, and I don't know where. 'It's about time that the world of football wakes up, and that the money coming into football remains in football, and doesn't disappear.' Kia Joorabchian,\u00a0head of Media Sports Investments, part-owned a number of high-profile players . Platini also said in the forum that the biggest misconception about him was that he alone took major decisions about football. He added: 'I think that the people in Europe, or in the world, they think that I take my decisions alone. But you have to understand one thing, I am very democratic and very transparent, and I never take a decision alone without the support of the executive committee or with the Congress of the UEFA. 'I listen to everybody very carefully and I take my decision, when it is necessary to take a decision, always for the good of the game and for the good of football. Don't think that I am very despotic.' Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano, pictured here in 2006, were some of\u00a0Joorabchian's TPO players .", "Controversial: Hertz installed the cameras as part of the in-car NeverLost app in 2014 . Car rental company Hertz has been slammed by customers for putting cameras inside their vehicles. The controversial device was installed as part of the in-car navigation system and guide, NeverLost 6 app, which was introduced in 2014. Drivers fear the lens is a breach of their privacy, but the firm insist they do not work and have no plans to turn them on. They also state they do not have the bandwidth capabilities to support video streaming. The cameras were added so drivers could interact with a member of the customer services team during an emergency or when stationary. To start a conversation, the motorist or a passenger would have been able to turn on the camera themselves - but because of technical difficulties the feature hasn't been integrated into the system. Rich Broome, a spokesman for Hertz, told the Daily Mail Online it would have been completely customer activated and could not have been turned on remotely. He added that there is 'nothing behind the lens' and there is no timetable to connect the device. However some drivers who regularly rent from Hertz have still expressed their concern at the camera's presence. One customer wrote on the forum Flyertalk: 'I am a regular renter from Hertz (President's Circle). This week after the usual excessive wait for the Hertz airport shuttle, I got into a rental car at O'Hare airport. 'I immediately noticed the new NeverLost and I was completely shocked to see a camera built into the device looking at me. The system can't be turned off from what could tell. Further investigation revealed that the camera can see the entire inside of the car. 'I know rental car companies have been tracking the speed and movements of their vehicles for years but putting a camera inside the cabin of the vehicle is taking their need for information a little too far. Breach of privacy? Some drivers have expressed their concern at the presence of the device, but the hire car firm said there is 'nothing behind the lens' and the camera simply doesn't work . 'I find this to be completely unacceptable In fact, if I get another car from Hertz with a camera in it, I will move our business from Hertz completely. I influence car rentals of many others and I don't think anyone would want to be on camera while they are driving around or sitting at a red light. 'Given what Hertz has invested in this system, I wonder how much consumer pressure will make them to pull the plug on this. Business is built one customer at a time and they will no longer have me as a customer.' The company told a Twitter user who criticized the use of the lens: 'The camera in the NeverLost device was never activated as we do not have adequate bandwidth capabilities to the car to\u00a0support streaming video at this time.' Mr Broome added that if any customer has any concerns with the device, they can simply switch to another car. Only 20 per cent of the cars have a camera inside. It is not the first time in-car recording technology has caused a stir. Last year Chevrolette released a new Corvette with a 'nanny cam' inside - aimed at keeping an eye on suspicious valets. But General Motors were forced to send an advisory to customers warning them not to use the product as it is illegal in some states.", "A fierce row has broken out between Stephen King and Maine Governor Paul LePage after the governor claimed that the author  doesn't pay state income taxes and has moved away from the state. King immediately shot back that LePage should 'man up and apologize' for the comments because he still resides in Maine. LePage's comments came during his weekly radio address when he argued that states without an income tax, like Florida, have lured away Maine residents, including King. Fight: Novelist Stephen King says he still lives in Maine, and insists that Governor Paul LePage's claim that he has moved from the state is inaccurate .

He said: 'Meanwhile, remember who introduced the income tax here in Maine. 'Well, today former Governor Ken Curtis lives in Florida where there is zero income tax. Stephen King and Roxanne Quimby have moved away, as well.' LePage's office withdrew the radio address Thursday, after learning that the  statement about King was\u00a0false. The corrected version, posted on the governor\u2019s official website, deleted the reference to King and Quimby. King spends winters in Florida but told the\u00a0Portland Press Herald\u00a0that he and his wife paid about $1.4 million in Maine state taxes in 2013 and likely paid about the same for 2014. He told the Portland Press Herald: 'In 2013, my wife and I paid approximately $1.4 million in state taxes. 'As this is a matter of public record, I have no problem telling you that. I would imagine 2014 was about the same, but I do not have those figures.' King has an estimated fortune of $400million from book publishing and movie rights, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. Tweet: King tweeted 'Governor Paul LePage implied that I don't pay my taxes. I do. Every cent. I think he needs to man up and apologize.' Backtracking:\u00a0LePage, right, withdrew the statement about King on Thursday after learning that it was false . The author's foundation awards $3 million to $5 million in grants annually, mostly in Maine. King, a best-selling author, has written over 55 successful horror novels. However, the remark prompted King, a legal resident of Maine  to say the governor 'was full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green.' King then tweeted Friday how much he paid the state in taxes over the last two years. The entire tax controversy stems from a plan being considered by the governor of Maine to overhaul tax. According to the Portland Press Herald, the plan would reduce the state income tax by raising the sales tax and applying it to new items and services. This, the Republican governor believes would encourage rich retirees and seasonal inhabitants to make Maine their primary domicile. However, the tax proposals have come under fierce criticism from Democrats in the state.", "A Jetstar Airways flight was forced to return to Melbourne \u2013 causing a delay for passengers and crew \u2013 after one of the travellers was caught drinking and smoking on board.

'He just seemed a lot more agitated, on edge,' she said. 'He was just very aggressive.' Testimony: Kasey Arma (pictured in court on Thursday) who danced with Hernandez at Rumor nightclub in Boston early on June 15, 2013 - two days before the alleged murder - said she thought he was agitated . 'On edge': She described how the former New England Patriots tight end initially seemed relaxed, but later appeared irritated, grabbing her and telling her to dance with him in another part of the club . Hernandez, 25, is on trial at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts, for fatally shooting Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating his fianc\u00e9e's sister, early on June 17, 2013. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole. Prosecutors say Hernandez became upset with Lloyd at the club that night for associating with people he disliked. Lloyd had gone to the club with Hernandez and his barber, Roberto Olivares, according to prosecutors. An acquaintance of Lloyd's who was also at the club, Kwami Nicholas, testified earlier this week that Hernandez stared for several minutes at Lloyd and another man, and appeared angry before storming out of the club, with Lloyd running to catch up. Arma, who had seen Hernandez at the club several times before, said Hernandez initially tapped her on the hip to get her attention. She said she danced with Hernandez, who introduced himself as 'Rock,' for several minutes before he abruptly walked away.

It showed Hernandez and two alleged accomplices, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, in different parts of the house, at times playing with Hernandez's baby daughter and swimming in his pool. Prosecutors say Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz picked up Lloyd at Lloyd's Boston house early on June 17, 2013, and drove him to an industrial park near Hernandez's house where his bullet-riddled body was later found. Wallace and Ortiz have also been charged with murder and will be tried separately. All have pleaded not guilty.

Owner and head chef Cameron Tobin said customers are asking: ''are you going to call it the Bali Seven in a couple of weeks time?'' Mr Tobin clarified he thought this suggestion was 'distasteful.'\u00a0He claimed the burger earned its name from having nine ingredients and a Balinese sauce, rather than referencing the nine people arrested in 2005 for trying to smuggle eight kilograms of heroin into Australia. 'People have a bit of a laugh, but then I explain to them the theory behind it and tell them that there are nine ingredients on the burger,' he said. Mr Tobin discovered the recipe for the burger when travelling through southeast Asia. While it is apparently his most popular item, that could be in part due to some customers believing it contains drugs. 'It is my best seller, but I get lots of people ask me if there are illicit products used in the making of the burger,' he said.

The 55-year-old was walking home from dinner with his girlfriend Anna Duritskaya when he was gunned down in Moscow on Friday. Nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. The most recent arrests were in 2011 when he protested the results of parliamentary elections and in 2012 when tens of thousands protested against Putin. In an interview with CNN's Anthony Bourdain last year, Nemtsov spoke of the deaths of other Kremlin critics, but said his fame offered some protection. \"I'm a well-known guy, and this is a safety because if something happens with me, it will be scandal not only in Moscow city but throughout the world,\" he said then. After Nemtsov was shot, Putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting, the Kremlin said in a statement. But critics of Putin have in the past suffered miserable fates. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of Russian journalist and fierce Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya. Business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps. Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put Putin in power. He was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in London in 2006. No killer has been caught. In their 2014 interview, Nemtsov told Bourdain he believed Russia's existing power structure was like 19th century Russia, with one person in control and no real freedom of press, real competition or elections or an independent judiciary or rule of law. \"You are in the typical country of crony capitalism,\" he said. \"If you have a good relationship with Putin and his people around, you will have a good relationship with governor or mayor -- it doesn't matter. If you are in the city you have a chance to raise money, to be successful ... you know, to buy real estate in the south of France or Switzerland, to open accounts in Swiss banks. \"But, if something happened between you and Putin and you are governor, you will be in jail.\" Nemstov said in most places around the world, wealth provided opportunity and independence, but said that it was different in Russia. \"To be wealthy, you must be loyal. If you want to be independent, forget about business, forget about raising money,\" he said. \"If you are rich, you are a slave. If you are rich, you are very much dependent.\" Many people preferred to be able make money and not speak out, he said. \"This is a country of corruption,\" Nemtsov said. \"For Putin's Russia, this is a system. This is not a problem.\" \"If you are corrupted, but you are loyal, and you serve the Kremlin, you are first of all rich and secondly you are in a very safe position.\"", "This is the moment rivalry turned ugly at a college basketball game as opposing cheerleaders became involved in a brawl.

The 31-year-old has twice beaten testicular cancer and only returned to the club after being given the all-clear following chemotherapy in November. He has since been building fitness with the Under-21s and was named on the bench for the first time last weekend. Newcastle winger Jonas Gutierrez (centre) has defied the odds to battle back from testicular cancer . Gutierrez replaced Newcastle defender Ryan Taylor in the second-half to the delight of the home fans . But Gutierrez finally made his first appearance in black and white in 17 months when he emerged midway through the second half as replacement for Ryan Taylor. St James' stood as one to welcome the fan favourite and close friend Fabricio Coloccini immediately handed the captain's armband to his Argentinian comrade. Gutierrez was booked soon after for a chop on Adnan Januzaj, but looked sharp with his every touch cheered by the Toon Army. And Newcastle head coach John Carver praised the substitute's impact, 'Maybe I should have started him!' 'The crowd came alive. He's worked tirelessly and it showed what the fans think of him \u2013 the roof nearly came off the stadium.' Newcastle, though, were beaten by Ashley Young's close-range strike in the dying seconds of what had been a feisty encounter.

They were among 90 prisoners invited to dine with the pontiff on his day-long trip to southern-Italy.

Adoration: Thousands of people turned out to cheer the Pope on his day-long visit to Naples where he will hold a number of events before returning to the Vatican tonight . Lucky few: The 90 prisoners who dined with the Pope were selected by lottery from about 1,900 others at the Giuseppe Salvia Detention Centre (pictured) The inmates who dined with the pope were chosen by lottery from around 1,900, the\u00a0Vatican Insider\u00a0website has reported. And it was a very simple and 'frugal' because the Pope wants to take the time to get to know every prisoner personally, the head of a prison ministry told\u00a0Vatican Radio. The prison visit formed part of a very busy day for Pope Francis in the Italian city that lies 150 miles south of Rome. Francis began praying at a sanctuary in Pompeii, before holding a string of events which include an outdoor mass and meetings with young people and the sick before heading back to the Vatican this evening. Since his election two years ago, the Argentine pontiff has led a new and welcoming approach to gay and transgender people. When asked whether a gay man could be a priest, he reportedly replied: 'Who am I to judge?' And in late January, he had a private meeting in the Vatican with a Spanish transgender man who wrote to Francs about the rejection he was facing at his home parish. On Holy Thursday next month, he will wash the feet of male and female inmates at a prison near Rome as part of his continued public outreach to detainees.

Before the lunch, Pope Francis called on members of organised crime to turn away from the violence to 'stop the tears of the mothers of Naples' in one of the city's most violent areas. He was speaking in the shadow of a housing project known as Le Vele which is considered so dangerous that even the police are sometimes afraid to enter. The blighted area has been a battleground for 'Camorra' clans fighting each other for control of drug trafficking and extortion rackets. He urged the locals not to let criminals rob them of their hope and also said members of organised crime excommunicate themselves from the Church - but it would welcome them back if they repent.", "A man has been shot dead by police after he was seen on tracks in a subway tunnel.

Andrei Alexandru Burnei was caught stealing just hours after he arrived in the country on March 9 and was arrested in Coventry. The 21-year-old was held overnight and released - but two days later he was caught trying to steal \u00a31,127 worth of vodka from Asda in Blackburn, hiding dozens of bottles beneath cheaper items in his trolley. Andrei Alexandru Brunei was caught stealing \u00a31,000 worth of vodka from Asda in Coventry - just three days after he arrived in the UK from Romania in a bid to look for work which had proved unsuccessful . Blackburn Magistrates' Court heard that Burnei, of Coventry, had come to the UK in hope of finding work but this had not materialised. On March 12 he was stopped as he left Asda in Blackburn because a security guard had become suspicious of him when he failed to make any eye contact. Burnei ran off but was eventually cornered and detained. His trolley was searched and found to be loaded with premium vodka, concealed beneath cheaper items from the store. Karen Saffman prosecuting, said: 'The value of his trolley load was extremely high.' At the hearing Burnei pleaded guilty to stealing the alcohol from Asda and was ordered to do 60 hours' unpaid work and pay a \u00a360 victim surcharge. The incident comes after\u00a0Ionut Tudorache, 25, was jailed for nine months earlier this month. The Romanian pickpocket was caught working as part of an organised gang, stealing mobile phones from people at a Kasabian gig at Bournemouth's International Centre. Tudorache, who had been in the UK just a few days, was caught stashing 22 stolen mobile phones down a pair of tights he was wearing beneath his trousers. He claimed two Romanian men he had met had started stuffing the phones down his tights and he had no idea they were stolen. At a hearing at Blackburn Magistrates' Court Brunei was sentenced to 60 hours unpaid work for the theft . He was jailed for nine months. Like Tudorache, Brunei is unlikely to be deported due to strict laws on removing EU citizens. Peter Bone, 62, Conservative MP for Wellingborough said: 'This is outrageous. 'Only a few weeks ago I introduced a bill to Parliament that would have dealt with this very situation. I have been calling for foreign criminals to be sent back to their respective countries immediately - with no opportunity for them to return and commit further offences. 'It's my view that if someone comes into Britain and breaks the law, they have abused our hospitality and should be sent home and not be allowed to come in again.' Without a court recommendation or tougher prison sentence, he can now only be removed at the behest of the Home Secretary. Scotland Yard recently claimed it had identified a trend in which eastern Europeans were being trafficked into the UK and forced to carry out upmarket shoplifting before returning home on budget airline flights. The gangs accept a 20 per cent arrest rate as the cost of a 'weekend trafficking' operation that can secure items worth up to \u00a3100,000 that are taken out of the country for resale.", "Imagine rolling out of bed into your train without even stepping outdoors.

Adam Lanza, 20, used the assault rifle to kill 20 first-grade students and six adults in Newtown on December 14, 2012. The younger Lanza was mentally unstable and used his mother's Bushmaster to kill her before he went on the rampage at the school, and then killed himself. At least eight lawsuits have been filed in Connecticut courts since January on behalf of relatives of 16 people killed in the massacre -- four adults and 12 children. Court documents also list two people who suffered serious injuries. In December, the parents of nine children killed at the mass shooting, along with one teacher who survived, filed a separate lawsuit against the businesses behind the Bushmaster rifle. Report finds missed chances to help Newtown shooter . The wrongful death lawsuit, filed one day after the second anniversary of the killings, named Camfour, a gun distributor; Riverview Gun Sales;  as well as the Freedom Group, the company that owns Bushmaster. It blamed the numerous lives lost in just 264 seconds on the shooter's weapon of choice, the Bushmaster. Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, the law firm for the families in the Bushmaster lawsuit, is also representing some families in the cases against Lanza's estate. The lawsuits were first reported Friday in the Connecticut Post, which said Nancy Lanza is believed to have had insurance on the home worth more than $1 million. \"Unlike our case against Bushmaster, Camfour (the distributor), and Riverview for the negligent entrustment and marketing of combat AR-15's designed for the military to inflict mass casualties against the enemy to civilians like Nancy Lanza, we expect this claim to be resolved quickly,\" attorney Josh Koskoff said of the estate lawsuits. The lawsuits claim that Nancy Lanza kept the rapid-fire Bushmaster in her home \"unsecured\" and that her \"carelessness and negligence\" contributed to the pain and suffering of the victims.

Jill told a Channel 5 documentary that she thinks the EU have 'death vans' and they will cut people's heads off with guillotines if they refuse to have microchips fitted . 'The EU already has the equipment set up and they have death vans like they have in China, equipped with guillotines. 'They will be sent to houses and work places basically saying receive the microchip or be killed. So off with your head and that's when things start getting unpleasant.' Jill - who says she once saw an angel in Tesco Express - doesn't just think Farage will save the nation with his foreign policies. She also believes UKIP is helping Brits become more liberated in the bedroom. She's a fan of bondage herself and says she has met many UKIP supporters who share her fondness for S&M. The former nurse is a fan of bondage and says many UKIP supporters share her passion for S&M . Jill is pictured demonstrating her hobby and is grateful Brits can now be more open about their sex lives . She said: 'I would love a cabinet position as head of bondage. It's my hobby and I do enjoy it, it's all role-play and froth, it's a natural English phenomenon to like it. 'Sometimes I like to be submissive and other times dominant. I have met a lot of UKIP supporters who are into BDSM. They do seem to have a natural bent towards bondage. 'I do think that Nigel Farage has bought a new era and openess to England where we can be more open about our needs to have our bottoms spanked.' The bondage enthusiast also believes UKIP can enhance the NHS by giving free cosmetic surgery to women who want it, like herself. 'I have been a nurse most of my life, I have my views about the NHS. I think people who need big breasts, who need their nose done, should receive help from the state,' Jill said. 'I think Nigel should look into this. I want big breasts. I have seen my surgeon and I am going to have implants. 'I think I should get them on the NHS. Nigel could get a higher women's vote by bringing that into play.'", "Under-fire BBC chief Rona Fairhead personally blocked the release of redacted information about a long-delayed investigation into Jimmy Savile, prompting fresh cover-up accusations. The controversial BBC Trust chairman approved a decision to keep secret details from a cache of potentially damaging letters between leading figures at the Corporation and the team carrying out a review of Savile\u2019s activities. Her decision last night deepened concerns about the Savile review being carried out by judge Dame Janet Smith, which has cost at least \u00a35 million and taken more than two years so far. BBC Trust chairman, Rona Fairhead, pictured, personally approved a decision to keep Jimmy Savile letters secret, preventing their release to a team conducting a review into the prolific paedophile's activities . The elements of correspondence Mrs Fairhead has kept hidden were thought to shed light on whether Corporation executives were trying to delay publication of the Savile report for fear that it would further damage the BBC\u2019s reputation. The BBC insists no such pressure was applied to delay the report. Last night critics said the censorship row showed Mrs Fairhead was not properly representing the licence fee-payer, as her \u00a3110,000 part-time role as chairman of the BBC Trust requires. The businesswoman, 53, has already come under fire from MPs over her \u00a310,000-a-day second job at HSBC. Allegations of her possible role in covering up evidence involving Savile \u2013 the biggest scandal in BBC history \u2013 will put further pressure on her to quit. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has written to the BBC about the sexual abuse review, said: \u2018The delay and the non-publication of the correspondence is not good for the licence fee-payer but it is probably good for the BBC in the run-up to its Charter review. It\u2019s all very convenient. \u2018I think that Rona Fairhead is compromised. As far as protecting licence fee-payers, she has gone native. She can\u2019t hold the BBC to account and what she said about the review only confirms my suspicion.\u2019 Mrs Fairhead\u2019s decision came at the end of a five-month battle by a transparency campaigner who used Freedom of Information Act requests to try to find out if BBC bosses had put pressure on Dame Janet to delay her report. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, left, said Ms Fairhead, right, is 'compromised' and has 'gone native' As chairman of the BBC governing body, Mrs Fairhead acts as the \u2018qualified person\u2019 to decide whether or not FoI requests should be refused on public interest grounds. In a three-page letter dated last December, she ruled that sensitive messages over delays to the Savile review should not be released. It is the only time so far she has acted in this capacity. She wrote: \u2018In my view, the public interest in demonstrating that the review is acting independently of the BBC and that the BBC is not putting unwarranted pressure on the review to delay delivery of the report has largely been served by the information already made available to the requestor.\u2019 The BBC has refused to answer questions about the review\u2019s ongoing costs. The most recent statement on the review website states it is \u2018not expected to be finalised until early 2015\u2019. A BBC spokesman said: \u2018We can confirm the correspondence shows no BBC member of staff has exerted any pressure on members of the review team to delay publication of the report.\u2019", "Two of boxing's greatest heavyweights descended on New York on Thursday night for a screening of new documentary\u00a0Champs.

Pritchett's 73-year-old grandmother, Joan Wiley, was taken to Aria Torresdale Hospital in critical but stable condition. Police said Pritchett, who suffered a laceration to his hand, initially blamed the attack on three unknown men in hooded sweatshirts who he claimed had broken into their home, reported Fox29, but his version of events did not add up. According to the family's neighbors, the 19-year-old was very troubled and the violent domestic attack was years in the making. Area resident Kelly McGrath told 6ABC Melizza Wiley seldom allowed her son out of the house, and most nights he could be heard screaming from the back room. Another neighbor, Stephanie Carbonaro, said on the eve of the killing, she and her house guests overheard Zachary Pritchett screaming at someone in the house, 'Please, leave me alone. Don't do this. Let go.' Officers who responded to the family's residence found deplorable conditions inside, including no running water, no cooking gas and human feces smeared on the floor.

Filming for the final episodes was completed months ago. Missouri native Hamm, 44, toiled in near-obscurity for years in Hollywood before finding fame in 2007 as the tormented, womanizing Draper, for which he won a Golden Globe for best actor in a TV drama. He has been nominated for an acting Emmy seven times for \"Mad Men\" but has never won.", "Britain's most dangerous roads are in Lincolnshire, a new report has revealed. The county was named as the place where more drivers, passengers and pedestrians were killed  than anywhere else in the country. The study also found that residents living in rural communities nationally were more likely to be 'killed or seriously injured' on the roads. This is because vehicles travel faster and there are fewer traffic calming measures, according to the research carried out by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTs) and Direct Line Car Insurance. Grimsby, pictured, had the highest road casualty rate on roads in Britain, according to a new study . This is compared to more urban areas where casualty rates were well below the national average. The report calculated the casualty rates for residents of each parliamentary constituency. Those in the North and East of England had the highest  in Britain, with both Lincolnshire and Lancashire having three constituencies each in the top ten. It concluded that Great Grimsby, Lincolnshire, had the highest road casualty rate in Britain. The town's casualty figures were 53 per cent higher her than the national average. Banff and Buchan in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, had the highest number of people killed or seriously injured, with figures 111 per cent above the national average. By contrast, South Wales had the lowest rates for  casualties killed or seriously injured. Four Cardiff constituencies, along with Torfaen and Newport West, ranked in the bottom 10. In 2013 a total of 183,670 people were reported injured on British roads, including 23,370 killed or seriously injured, at a cost to society of \u00a315 billion. There are three main factors affecting deaths and serious injury on the roads, the report said. The first is the driver's behaviour, including speeding, drink and drug driving, non-use of seat-belts and use of mobiles behind the wheel. Grimsby's casualty figures were 53 per cent higher than the national average. Pictured: Grimsby . The second is the safety quality of the road network itself and the vehicles using it, and the third is the quality of emergency medical system and trauma care in that particular region. David Davies, Executive Director of PACTS said: 'Road collisions remain a major cause of death and serious injury in Britain. 'Traffic danger has a significant negative influence on society, it discourages people from walking or cycling, restricts the freedom of children and means vulnerable road users feel intimidated. 'Despite great improvements in emergency services and trauma care, thousands of victims of road collisions are left with life-changing injuries while the families of casualties also find their lives changed forever.' Mike Holliday-Williams, Managing Director Personal Lines at Direct Line added: 'Good information is an essential basis for effective road safety action. 'Now, for the first time, MPs have specific road casualty information based on their constituency boundaries and its residents. 'We hope the Road Safety Dashboard will provide a catalyst for action aimed at reducing deaths and injury at a local level, as the diversity of results demonstrate there is a no 'one size fits all' solution . 'The Dashboard will become a vital tool in helping improve the safety of Britain's roads.", "Janet Napolitano, the president of the University of California system and former U.S. Homeland Security secretary, publicly apologized Thursday for calling chants by students protesting tuition hikes 'crap,' a remark overheard on an open microphone at a board of regents meeting. Napolitano, also a former Arizona governor, opened a regents meeting by expressing contrition, a day after the university's recording of a Wednesday gathering captured her saying, 'We don't have to listen to this crap,' when she leaned over to the board chairman who had just activated his microphone. The comment came after several dozen students in the University of California system stripped off their shirts at Wednesday's meeting, tossed fake money in the air and stood on chairs chanting 'egregious, step off it, put people over profits'.

University of California Berkeley student Kristian Kim throws fake money while starting a protest during a UC Board of Regents meeting in San Francisc . Students were protesting tuition increases of up to five per cent in each of the next five years, what they say is a lack of support for black students at UC Berkeley and concern that a possible new campus in Richmond would displace low-income residents. The proposed increase would see next year's base cost for students rise from $12,192 up to $12,804 and  to $15,564 by 2019. Napolitano apologized Thursday 'for using a word that she doesn't normally use, which was picked up on the mike', Dianne Klein, spokeswoman for the University of California Office of the President, said in an email. She added: '[Napolitano] suggested that many of us have been in similar situations where an inadvertent comment was overheard'. Klein said the time allotted for public comments had ended Wednesday when protesters interrupted. 'This went on for quite some time and when the participants ignored police instructions to end their protest, the board chair began following the established procedure to temporarily shut down the meeting,' Klein said. Napolitano's comment reflected her personal frustration with disruptions that hinder discussions on topics 'vital to the future of the university and the education of its students,' Klein said.

A police officer who had sex with women while he was on duty asked one of them to 'send some filth' in a text message, a court heard. Staffordshire Police officer Adam Rushton is accused of having sex with four women while he was on duty, including one dalliance at a police station where a woman is said to have put handcuffs on him. One of the women who Rushton is accused of seducing said they had sex around five times and he also asked her to send dirty pictures in a text messages. He first met the woman, then 21, after she reported a burglary in July 2006, Birmingham Crown Court heard. Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman said she kept in touch with Rushton after the incident - informing him of her new address every time she moved as well as her contact details. She said she kept in touch with him in case she needed anything or to be protected. In November 2011, Rushton sent the woman a text, which read: 'Still waiting, send some filth'. She told the jury: 'By 2011, I had known Adam for quite a while. Contact could go on for a month and then he would not hear from me for a while. 'He may have asked for pictures from me, some intimate pictures maybe but I replied telling him \"no, I am not sending naughty pics to your work phone.\"' The woman described Rushton as a 'nice police officer' and said on one occasion they had sex after he turned up in his police uniform. She added: 'Adam was the only person to give a damn. If I had said \"Adam, no I am not going to send anything,\" he would have stopped. There was no pressure. 'I think at the time I used Adam but only when I needed somebody. 'There might have been other texts but I cannot remember. 'We never met anywhere sordid. We had sex four or five times.

Prosecutor Duncan Bould said: 'He picked her up in a marked car, in uniform, and she had to wait in the car while he checked the coast was clear.' Mr Bould said the only purpose for taking the woman into the station was 'sexual activity,' But he said as she put his handcuffs on him and things started to go further they were disturbed and had to leave. On another occasion, the court heard Rushton persuaded a woman to show him her private parts after he turned up at her home.

Jimmy thinks of Wembley and, as much as the match \u2014 which he would enjoy \u2014 he imagines the queues of traffic on the North Circular, the hassles of parking and of spending the hour before kick-off having a big fuss made about his presence when he would rather be sat with a pot of tea in front of Liverpool and Manchester City and then the rugby. Jim loves the rugby. Truth be told, if Ireland versus England captured his attention, he might even have delayed changing channels until it was over. He finds it strange that people are still interested in getting him to Wembley. We want our heroes to behave like besotted fans, but Jim\u2019s interests were always broader. Greaves' interests were always broader than just football, and he should be left to enjoy his retirement . He liked playing, and was quite brilliant at it, but since retiring he\u2019s as likely to be engrossed in a Test match as a cup final, and he hasn\u2019t the ego to wish to be feted wherever he goes. He doesn\u2019t claim to be an expert on the modern game, having not been a part of it for so long, but feels no animosity towards the Premier League or its high-earning players. For a man whose problems with alcohol led him to a psychiatric unit shortly after retirement, the second act of Jim\u2019s life has been a triumph. We should perhaps acknowledge this, rather than wonder why he isn\u2019t constantly seeking attention or another lap of honour. We should wish every former athlete the quiet contentment of Jimmy Greaves. Greaves doesn't claim to be an expert about the modern game, and didn't want to attend the League Cup fianl .", "Members of a middle school basketball team in Wisconsin are set to be honored with a citzenship award after they stepped in to support a cheerleader who was abused by rival fans.

She was performing her duties as a member of the Lady Knight's Cheerleading Squad at a game last year when some members of the crowd started picking on her. Desiree Andrews, who has Down syndrome, was performing her duties as a member of the Lady Knight's Cheerleading Squad at a game last year when some members of the crowd started picking on her . Lincoln Middle School basketball players, from left to right, Chase Varquez, Miles Rodriguez and Scooter Terrien overheard Desiree being abused they called a timeout in their game, walked off the court and confronted the bullies . When basketball players Miles Rodriguez, Scooter Terrien and Chase Vazquez overheard Desiree being abused they called a timeout in their game, walked off the court and confronted the bullies. 'A couple of us went over there and were like, can you guys just stop, that's not right,' Rodriguez told TMJ4. 'Our teammates supported us and they had our backs,' said Terrien. The incident sparked the begining of a beautiful friendship between Desiree and the boys. From then on\u00a0Desiree \u2013 who they call affectionately Dee \u2013 got involved in the introduction of the starting lineup for the team. They would also walk her to class and the gym was renamed 'D's House' in her honor. 'We're all created the same. God made us the same way,' said Terrien. Desiree was performing her duties as a member of the Lady Knight's Cheerleading Squad at a game last year when some members of the crowd started picking on her . On Monday the team played their last game in the gymnasium before they all move on to high school. The match was dedicated to Dee and the team chanted, 'Whose house? Dee's house!' Desiree loved every minute of it. 'It was sweet, kind, awesome, amazing,' she said. Her father Cliff Andrews said the team's support for his daughter has 'been a godsend.' 'Those boys, I tried to talk to them in person, but I couldn't keep the tears back,' he told Kenosha News. The story has generated so much positive coverage for the school in the local area that Kenosha City council has announced that it will give the boys a citizenship award next week. They are also being considered for the mayor's youth award. The gymnasium at Lincoln Middle School has been renamed D's House in honor of Desiree Andrews .", "A Palestinian refugee achieved his lifetime ambition to one day own a lion when he adopted two of them and brought them into his home. Saad al-Jamal purchased the two-month-old lion cubs from the cash-strapped Rafah zoo. He has plans to raise them at his house in the Al-Shabora refugee camp in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, although he faces a difficult task as the lions - and their appetites - grow. Saad al-Jamal holds the lions in his arms as one of them struggles in an effort to get back on the ground . Mr al-Jamal\u00a0plans to raise the cubs at his house in the Al-Shabora refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip . He refused to say how much he paid for the cubs, but admitted to AFP that he has received a $9,000 offer (\u00a36,000) to buy them. The two lion cubs, one male and one female, have been named Alex and Mona. They have been living in the three-bedroom flat \u2018like members of the family\u2019 for 10 weeks, and they play 'all day long' with Mr al-Jamal's children and grandchildren. Footage shows the cubs play-fighting on the floor of the family's flat, and interacting with young children. The lion cubs can be seen on the video interacting with Mr al-Jamal\u2019s children and grandchildren . Bringing the cubs outside, Mr al-Jamal holds the lions in his arms and as of them fights against him to be put back down. Other clips show the owner is featured stroking them as they bask in the sun. It is believed that the parents of the cubs were brought into Gaza via a tunnel along the border with Egypt around three years ago. Raising two lion cubs is a costly venture, and Mr al-Jamal has plans to use them to earn money. He intends to lease them to parks, restaurants and seaside resorts once they are a few months older. Saad Al-Jamal purchased the two-month-old lion cubs called Alex and Mona from the Rafah zoo . Once the cubs are 15-months-old they will develop adult teeth and possess the ability to tear flesh . At just two months, the cubs eat half a kilogram of meat a day, and their appetites will become even larger as they get older. Right now the animals are at an age where they are unable to inflict any real damage. But once the cubs reach 15-months-old they will develop adult teeth and will possess the ability to tear flesh. At which point, Mr al-Jamal\u2019s living situation might not be so harmonious.", "Budget prices: Aldi\u00a0is introducing Wagyu burgers at \u00a32.99 each in a bid to chase\u00a0from New Zealand as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers . An A list celebrity might spend \u00a329 on a Wagyu burger at London\u2019s Dorchester Hotel \u2013 after all it is renowned around the world as a byword for luxury given its flavour and succulence. Alternatively, you could try the local Aldi, where the budget chain is introducing Wagyu burgers at \u00a32.99 each. The budget chain is to offer a limited stock of Wagyu burgers made with beef imported from New Zealand as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers. Normally, luxury restaurants, stores and gourmet butchers sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye-watering \u00a3100 per kilo \u2013 so putting it out of reach for most families. However, Aldi is bringing the beef, which originated with pampered cattle in Japan, to the masses. Last year the company sold Wagyu sirloin and rib-eye steaks at \u00a36.99 each, which resulted in something of a stampede among the BMW-driving classes. It believes the burgers will be similarly successful. Wagyu beef stands out from other meat because of its distinctive marbling with fat, which melts into the meat during cooking to produce a fabulous taste and moist texture. The cattle were initially introduced to Japan as a beast of burden to help cultivate rice during the 2nd century. Beer was fed to the animals during the hot summers to stimulate appetite, while massaging was used to prevent muscles cramping on small farms in Japan where the animals did not have sufficient room to move around. Kobe beef is the purest, highest quality of the meat, which is produced from the black Tajima-ushi breed of Wagyu cattle and raised according to strict tradition. However, the demand and appetite for the beef is now so great that herds are now being reared across the globe, including the UK and New Zealand. Beef from\u00a0Wagyu cows is sold for as much as\u00a0\u00a3100 per kilo in luxury restaurants\u00a0and gourmet butchers . Aldi said the decision to stock the burgers was inspired by the menu at the Oscars ball. Stars such as Bradley Cooper, Eddie Redmayne and Julianne Moore were amongst the 1,500 members of Hollywood royalty to dine at infamous Governors Ball, where Mini American Wagyu Burgers served with Aged Cheddar were on the menu. The chain\u2019s managing director of corporate buying, Tony Baines, said: \u2018At Aldi our shoppers love to try out lots of specialist products, and Wagyu is no exception. Following the frenzy around the Wagyu steaks Aldi sold last summer, we wanted to offer something new that would excite our customers. Following his Oscar success, Eddie Redmayne dined at the\u00a0Governors Ball where Mini American Wagyu Burgers served with Aged Cheddar were on the menu . \u2018Aldi\u2019s Specially Selected Wagyu Burgers are made from premium quality Wagyu beef, and are available at an everyday low price, which our customers have come to know and love.\u2019 At the Dorchester Bar, the \u00a329 Wagyu burger is served with tomato relish and truffle mayonnaise. Aldi suggests teaming its version with its Specially Selected Brioche Burger Buns, which are 99p for four, and a pack of Roquefort cheese, which is \u00a32.29. That would give a price for the Aldi version of less than \u00a34 \u2013 assuming you only need a few slices of the cheese.", "Andy Murray led a chorus of tennis players giving drugs cheat Wayne Odesnik a send-off after the American player was effectively banned for life for committing another doping offence. The American journeyman was handed a 15-year ban after being found to have taken several banned substances, including steroids, in out-of-competition tests carried out in December and January. The severity of the ban for the 29-year-old world No 267 owes itself to Odesnik already having been given a two-year ban when he was found in 2010 by Australian customs officials to be importing vials of human growth hormone at Melbourne Airport. American tennis player Wayne Odesnik has been banned for 15 years after a second doping violation . \u2018Goodbye Wayne \u2026 good riddance,\u2019 tweeted Murray, who has been among the more vociferous players calling for an extension of anti-doping measures in tennis. Andy Roddick joined in the condemnation of Odesnik who, even before 2010, was deeply unpopular in the locker room. He tweeted: \u2018My feelings are that he\u2019s a d*****bag and I hate that he has a US flag to his name when he\u2019s cheating, good riddance.\u2019 Veteran British doubles player Jamie Delgado chimed in: \u2018Wayne Odesnik cheats again, what a joke. Get out of the sport mate.\u2019 Murray later beat Adrian Mannarino 6-3, 6-3 at the BNP Paribas Open and will face Spain\u2019s Feliciano Lopez in the quarter-finals. It was Murray\u2019s 496th win, equalling Tim Henman\u2019s record for a British man in the Open Era. After his victory, Murray spoke further on Odesnik's ban. He told the BBC: 'I think it's a good thing for tennis that he's off the tour. Andy Murray tweeted 'bye bye Wayne... good riddance' before his win over Adrian Mannarino in Indian Wells . 'He was given a second chance in a way. He was a cheat so it is good for everyone involved in tennis that he's been dealt with in the right way. 'I think any doping in any sport is very bad. I think it's the job of the sports when cases do come up that they treat them very strictly and in the right way. 'I think [testing] is going in the right direction but I don't think it will ever be perfect.' Odesnik issued a statement maintaining his innocence, claiming he had accidentally ingested substances through taking an over-the-counter supplement, but he has little credit in the bank, especially after being linked to the notorious Biogenesis clinic in Florida two years ago. Tennis has stepped up its drug-testing regime and introduced a biological passport, but many still feel that a wealthy game should allocate more resources. The fact that Odesnik was initially caught this time in December shows the value of more expensive out-of-competition testing compared to the cheaper option of doing it at major tournaments, where it is most expected.", "A big debate researchers have been having about how small life on Earth can get may be over. Scientists from the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, captured photos of 'ultra-small bacteria' for the first time. The photos may end a debate which has been raging for two decades.about whether the tiny bacteria exist or not. Scientists from the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, captured photos of 'ultra-small bacteria' (pictured) Scientists say that the ultra-small bacteria cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns which means that almost 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an Escherichia coli cell . The comprehensive electron microscopy images and DNA-based description of the microbes researchers were able to obtain seem to indicate the bacteria are very small - but very real. Ultra-small bacteria cells\u00a0have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns [one micron is one millionth of a meter], according to Berkeley Lab. Close to 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an Escherichia coli cell. More than 150,000 Escherichia cells could fit onto the tip of a single human hair. The bacteria were found in groundwater and are believed to be rather common. In their abstract, the scientists wrote: 'Ultrastructural features potentially related to cell and genome size minimization include tightly packed spirals inferred to be DNA, few densely packed ribosomes and a variety of pili-like structures that might enable inter-organism interactions that compensate for biosynthetic capacities inferred to be missing from genomic data. 'The results suggest that extremely small cell size is associated with these relatively common, yet little known organisms.' Since it was founded in 1931, Berkeley Lab (pictured above) has been recognized with 13 Nobel prizes . Findings about the bacteria were published in the Nature Communications\u00a0journal. A UC Berkeley professor in the departments of Earth and Planetary Science and Environmental Science, Policy and Management,\u00a0Jill Banfield, co-wrote the paper with Birgit Luef, a reearchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Banfield said: 'These newly described ultra-small bacteria are an example of a subset of the microbial life on earth that we know almost nothing about. 'They're enigmatic. 'These bacteria are detected in many environments and they probably play important roles in microbial communities and ecosystems. 'But we don't yet fully understand what these ultra-small bacteria do.' Luef said their research was 'a significant step in characterizing the size, shape, and internal structure of ultra-small cells'. She added: 'There isn't a consensus over how small a free-living organism can be, and what the space optimization strategies may be for a cell at the lower size limit for life.' Since it was founded in 1931, Berkeley Lab has been recognized with 13 Nobel prizes.", "Naypyidaw, Myanmar (CNN)Twenty-one people are dead and 21 missing after a ferry capsized in the Southeast Asia nation of Myanmar. Myanmar's Ministry of Information said in a statement that the ship capsized Friday night as it sailed, in bad weather conditions, around the city of Sittwe. That's when a large wave crashed into the ferry, causing it capsize near Myaybone and Myaukkyine islands. Authorities have managed to rescue at least 167 people, according to the information ministry for Myanmar, which is also known as Burma. Pictures from the government showed rescue workers helping people off a boat onto the land. Sittwe is the capital of Rakhine state and sits on the Bay of Bengal, about 55 miles (90 kilometers) from the Bangladesh border. This weekend's weather forecast for the city calls for some clouds giving way to clear skies, with high daytime temperatures expected to be in the 30s Celsius (80s to 90s Fahrenheit). Fatal ferry disasters are nothing new to the region. Last month, at least 68 people died when a packed double-decker ferry sank while on the Padma River north of neighboring Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, officials said. A cargo vessel hit the ferry, causing it to overturn and trapping passengers on its lower deck. Forty-five people died in an accident on the same river in August. In May 2013, several boats carrying as many as 150 people were thought to have capsized near Myanmar's western coast ahead of a storm approaching the area. Those boats were carrying Rohingya, members of Myanmar's long-suffering Muslim minority, Thailand-based U.N. official Kirsten Mildren said at the time.

South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham insisted that he would happily let anyone look at his emails because he had never needed to send one. The comments were made on Meet the Press during a discussion about the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private server and personal email account to conduct foreign policy. South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham insisted that he would happily let anyone look at his emails because he had never needed to send one . But Graham, who was a congressman for eight years before becoming a senator, insisted that he had nothing to hide. 'I don't email. No, you can have every email I've ever sent. I've never sent one,' he revealed on Sunday's Meet the Press. 'I don't know what that makes me.' The 59-year-old told Chuck Todd that it was crucial to get an independent body to retrieve and vet Clinton's emails properly. Senior figures in Congress are already intensifying their scrutiny of the former secretary of state's communications from 2009-13, which they say were not conducted via official State Department accounts. Clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of communications from the time - but it has been claimed that the documents have 'huge gaps'. One image, which Clinton has used as her Twitter profile picture for the last year, has also been studied  to suggest that vital communications are being deliberately held from public view. It shows a stony-faced Clinton using her mobile while heading to Tripoli on a C-military plane in September 2011. Rep. Trey Gowdy told CBS News\u00a0he had been provided with no emails from the 2011 trip - despite Clinton being pictured allegedly communicating while aboard the plane. He said: 'There are gaps of months and months and months. The comments were made during a discussion about the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private server and personal email account to conduct foreign policy. This image of Clinton, taking during a 2011 trip, is also being scrutinized . 'And if you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya, she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand, we have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip. 'So, it's strange credibility to believe that if you're on your way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy that there's not a single document that has been turned over to Congress.' President Obama has also revealed he heard that Clinton used a private email account to conduct official state business at 'the same time as everybody else' when news reports surfaced.", "The body of an ex-Royal Marine who was the first Briton to be killed while fighting against ISIS has been returned to his family in a 'comforting' ceremony attended by hundreds of Syrian Kurds.

A recent buy-to-let boom has been partly driven by retired Britons looking to invest in property. And estate agents say the interest from older investors in property is putting an even greater strain on Britain\u2019s limited housing stock. Retirees have increasingly turned to buy-to-let to get a better return on their savings at a time when banks are offering the worst interest rates on record. First-time buyers are being pushed out of the housing market by the rise of so-called 'granlords' who are looking to invest their pensions in property, experts have warned (file picture) The industry is now predicting that even more \u2018granlords\u2019 will buy homes to rent out from April, when reforms make it easier for the over-55s to cash in their pensions. This is likely to drive up prices even further at the lower end of the market, making modest, first-time properties even more unaffordable for young buyers who are trying to take their first step on the property ladder. Miles Shipside, of property website Rightmove, said: \u2018While many pension pots may not fund a sufficiently large tax-free lump sum to facilitate a property purchase, for some it will provide enough for a deposit. \u2018Agents report a high level of interest from \u201cgranlords\u201d \u2013 new landlords who are typically first-time, retirement-age, buy-to-let investors.\u2019 David Blythman, of Scottfraser estate agent, Oxfordshire, said: \u2018Since the beginning of the year there has been no let-up in demand for properties across Oxfordshire and our investment search division are now receiving a significant uplift in enquiries including many from \u2018granlords\u2019 - first time, retirement age, buy-to-let investors diversifying their pension investments. \u2018We foresee these buyers having a positive impact on the quality of the private rental sector as they have no intention of squandering their hard earned funds on anything other than the best properties.\u2019 Estate agents say the interest from older investors  is putting an even greater strain on Britain\u2019s limited housing stock (file picture) Britain is in the middle of a buy-to-let boom as middle-income \u2018amateur\u2019 landlords invest in property.

LaBeouf pleaded guilty to two counts of disorderly conduct, one count of trespass, one count of criminal trespass and harassment in the second degree  last September, and was ordered to undergo continued alcohol treatment. The judge today announced she would drop the charges however in another six months if the actor was found to have complied with the program and stayed out of trouble. Scroll down for video . Shia LaBeouf appeared in Manhattan criminal court today for a progress report following disorderly conduct charges he pled guilty to in September .

LaBeouf showed up for court in a well-tailored grey suit and tie, though he kept his rat tail and eyebrow ring . The progress report comes after LaBeouf (above with lawyer) pleaded guilty in September. A judge said that if he sought treatment for alcohol and stayed out of trouble the charges would be dropped . LaBeouf, who showed up in a well-tailored grey suit and tie while still keeping his rat tail and eyebrow ring, said little to the judge, and the proceedings were over in less than an hour. During the Cabaret melee, LaBeouf screamed profanities at performers and then slapped Cumming on the behind as he performed at the emcee.

The elephant calf, wandering close to its mother for support decides to raise a leg to its trunk . But in doing so, the overconfident youngster wobbles and attempts to correct his balance . Unable to correct itself, the calf then collapses into a heap on the ground . It then gives up completely, flopping onto its side in the dry riverbank while its mother looks on . She said: 'Young elephants are one of my favourite species to photograph, they are so adorable. 'If they are not playing and being mischievous they are acting like clowns while trying to find their feet. 'This youngster completely lost its footing in the dry riverbed and then when it finally struggled to its feet proceeded to examine one of its feet like it was to blame for it falling over.' She added: 'In the meantime the mother just carried on patiently grazing, though you could see she was keeping a watch on the youngster out of the corner of her eye'. Adult elephants take a great deal of care of calves, helping them climb steep banks and protecting them from predators.

But this video released by Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska shows the ingenious way to top up the tank without losing any air miles. Captured on camera is the moment the F-16 skilfully flies up behind a tanker aircraft and steadies itself in the skies over snowy Alaska. The F-16 fighter jet skilfully flies up behind the main aircraft and steadies itself while getting into position . A large nozzle extends from the back of the tanker plane and then manoeuvres towards the fighter jet. The jet moves into position, allowing the nozzle to enter a small triangular hole at the top of the F-16. The two planes maintain their speed as the snowy Alaskan landscape flashes by below them, and the fuel transfers from one to the other. Receiving enough fuel to carry on its flight, the fighter jet pulls away from the larger plane and flies off. The large nozzle hanging from the bottom of the plane manoeuvres towards the fighter jet and it latches on . The process is then repeated with another plane moments later. Eielson Air Force Base and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson are the home of RED FLAG-Alaska, who execute tactical air combat employment exercises. The exercises are designed to help pilots gain more experience by having them deal with the stresses war fighters go through while flying, but in controlled conditions. The two planes maintain their speed while flying over Alaska as fuel is transferred from one to the other . After receiving enough fuel to carry on its flight, the fighter jet pulls away from the larger aircraft . The crews are subjected to a number of conceivable combat threats, and up to 70 jet fighters can be operating in the same airspace at one time. On average, however, more than 1,000 US Air Force members and up to 60 aircraft deploy to Eielson, and an additional 500 people and 40 aircraft deploy to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for each event. The exercises also provide an operations training environment for participants such as unit-level intelligence experts, maintenance crews, and command and control elements. Refuelling in the air is an example of a tactical exercise pilots are required to demonstrate.", "Police are continuing to make inquiries into an alleged biting incident involving Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie. The 24-year-old, who has been banned for biting before, was accused of sinking his teeth into the hand of Stevenage defender Ronnie Henry during Saturday's League Two fixture at the Lamex Stadium.

The injury appears to be a recurrence of the one that kept Benteke out of the FA Cup victory over West Bromwich Albion.

On Benteke, Sherwood said: 'He's had a problem with his hip. In the end he had to come off because it was too sore to continue. I don't know how bad it is, he's being assessed now by the physios.

Steve Ashton, 50, was awarded just \u00a33,125 after a two-year legal battle. Mr Ashton, who was repeatedly abused by the late DJ from the age of ten, told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018I would have got more for whiplash. 'It makes you wonder how many more of Savile\u2019s victims have been fobbed off with such a derisory amount.\u2019 Victim:\u00a0Steve Ashton (left) who was abused by Jimmy Savile when he was 10, \u00a0was awarded\u00a0\u00a33,125 after a two-year legal battle . Mr Ashton said his case was not about the money, but he felt the figure was a snub to all victims. \u2018What is this going to show to other people in this situation?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Do they want to go through years of absolute hell for such an amount? Hundreds of people who have yet to come forward will think, \u201cI\u2019m not having my life made into an open book for such a small amount.\u201d It\u2019s a disgrace. \u2018No money can make up for Savile\u2019s effect on my life. But there should be some recognition from the authorities of the damage done.\u2019 Mr Ashton added that his payout, which had been contested by the NHS Charitable Trust, \u2018is probably one day\u2019s work for the law firm that represented me\u2019. He added: \u2018You hear of celebrities receiving \u00a350,000 after having their phones hacked, but how does that compare with being sexually molested as a ten-year-old boy again and again? \u2018I\u2019ve been going through this for 40 years and I still feel Savile laughing at me.\u2019 Mr Ashton\u2019s award was calculated using a compensation \u2018tariff\u2019, which sets payouts at between \u00a31,500 for indecent assault over clothing to \u00a340,000 for rape. Victims are entitled to more if they can prove lasting psychiatric damage or repeated abuse. The compensation scheme, set up jointly by Savile\u2019s estate, the BBC, the NHS, children\u2019s charity Barnardos and lawyers acting for the victims, was finally approved by the Court of Appeal three months ago. Payments capped at \u00a360,000 have been awarded to more than 200 people who applied. Each claim triggers payments of up to \u00a316,000 to lawyers. \u2018My law firm was very caring, but they will come out of this far wealthier and happier than I did,\u2019 Mr Ashton said. He added that he was advised he might be able to secure more by continuing his fight in the High Court, but decided not to as success was not guaranteed. Savile befriended Mr Ashton at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where the victim\u2019s mother Pamela worked as a spinal injuries researcher. The abuse happened in the Porter\u2019s Lodge and in Savile\u2019s private room at the hospital. Mr Ashton recalled: \u2018He used to say, \u201cThis is our secret.\u201d \u2018If everywhere was busy he would take me to the mortuary.
