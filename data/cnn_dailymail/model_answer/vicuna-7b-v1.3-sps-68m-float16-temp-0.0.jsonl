A plan to draw up a \u2018death list\u2019 of how every ill or elderly person wants to die has been criticised as a dangerous and worrying idea. The influential Commons Health Select Committee yesterday called for a new database listing whether people would prefer to die at home or in hospital. They said two-thirds want to spend their final days at home \u2013 but half still die in hospital. A register of preferred options would help to stop this happening, MPs on the committee said. But Professor Patrick Pullicino, a leading neurologist, said the plan simply perpetuates the \u2018central flaw\u2019 of the discredited Liverpool Care Pathway. The professor, who was the first senior doctor to expose the failures of the LCP three years ago, said such a register carried huge risks.
