This will help you understand how to best approach a project in the future.\n\nWeb Forms and MVC: The Basics\n\nHi, I'm Alex Wolf, and welcome to this course on Rebuilding Web Forms Applications in MVC. I'm really excited about this topic because it's one of the more common DEV scenarios that I've seen in the last few years. Companies are continually looking to improve their applications. Often they want to migrate to a newer technology at the same time for added value. Rebuilding and improving an application in parallel can be a daunting challenge and that's why this course exists. Our main goal is to smooth that transition from one framework to another. We'll approach this task using a two tiered approach. First we'll examine what high level concepts remain the same between web forms and MVC. Remember both frameworks sit on top of the same ASP. NET platform so they do share some common infrastructure. Secondly, I'll demonstrate how the more specific implementation details of these concepts do vary between the two frameworks. This will help you understand how to best approach a project in the future.\n\nWeb Forms and MVC: The High Level\n\nHi, I'm Alex Wolf, and welcome to this course on Rebuilding Web Forms", "decoding_steps": 36, "new_tokens": 256, "wall_time": 3.228973388671875, "accept_lengths": []}], "tstamp": 1745339480.4732163}

We'll then step through our applications data layer to get a better idea of the structure that we'll be working with. We also want to finish rebuilding the actual HTML of our form using Razor, which will help make our markup more dynamic and more friendly for model binding.

They are very easy to kill and are very easy to fall unconscious. This is by design. The game has devised a series of fractional Challenge Ratings for these characters to face but most of them are capable with a single roll bringing a character down. This is by design I believe to drive the feeling of fragility of low level characters and a feeling of dread. My umbrage with this situation is that randomness is often the most important factor in an outcome instead of player ingenuity and careful decision making. It also creates a dichotomy of how the game works between early levels and the rest of the game. I believe a little padding is better, to allow the randomness to regress to the mean - while sometimes good and bad luck swing the situation, every roll isn't a potential death knell.
